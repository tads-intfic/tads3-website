Quick Start Guide</a><br />
by Eric Eve
<p>This brief guide is probably the best place to start for newcomers to
TADS 3. It contains instructions for installing the system and compiling
a basic game, an explanation of the other documentation, including
guidance on where to go next, and a sample game newcomers can experiment
with if they want to dive straight it.</p></td>

Started in TADS 3</a><br />
by Eric Eve
<p>This tutorial introduction is a great starting point for anyone new
to TADS 3 and new to programming. The book opens with the basics of
getting TADS working on your system and setting up your first simple
game, so even if you've never done any programming before, this will
help you get going quickly. The tutorial then leads you step by step
through the design of a full-scale example game, showing how to use TADS
to implement the effects needed in the game. By the time you're done,
you'll know your way around the system and you'll be able to write your
own games.</p>
<p><em>This book is accompanied by a sample game,</em> The Further
Adventures of Heidi<em>. The game's source files can be found here:</em>

<p>Part tutorial and part reference, <em>Learning TADS 3</em> is a
perfect place to start for confident beginners, and for people with a
little more programming experience. This book is designed for learning
TADS on your terms - it's organized by functional area, so once you've
mastered the basics, you can skip around to focus on the areas you're
most interested in. As you develop your game, you can return to the book
as a reference, to review the details of particular TADS features.</p>

by Michael Roberts
<p>TADS 3 uses a variant of HTML as its formatting language. These notes
explain how HTML fits into TADS, and how you can use HTML formatting
codes for text effects, graphics, and sound, and how the TADS variant
differs from standard HTML. (These are essentially just the original
notes for HTML TADS 2, so they're a little rough, but they are updated
with relevant changes for TADS 3. Note that this isn't an HTML tutorial
- but the HTML in TADS is pretty close to standard HTML, so you can
learn it from any of the many tutorials on the Web for ordinary
HTML.)</p></td>
