A pending command marker. This is not an actual pending command; rather,
it's just a queue marker. We sometimes want to synchronize some other
activity with an actor's progress through its command queue; for
example, we might want one actor to wait until another actor has
executed a particular pending action. These markers can be used for this
kind of synchronization; they move through the queue like ordinary
pending commands, so we can tell if an actor has reached a particular
command by observing the marker's progress through the queue.
