A "room part item" is an object that's specially described as being part
of, or attached to, a RoomPart (a wall, ceiling, floor, or the like).
This is a mix-in class that can be combined with any ordinary object
class (but usually with something non-portable, such as a Fixture or
Immovable). The effect of adding RoomPartItem to an object's
superclasses is that a command like EXAMINE EAST WALL (or whichever room
part the object is associated with) will display the object's
specialDesc, but a simple LOOK will not. This class is sometimes useful
for things like doors, windows, ceiling fans, and other things attached
to the room.

Note that this is a mix-in class, so you should always combine it with a
regular Thing-based class.

When using this class, you should define two properties in the object:
specialNominalRoomPartLocation, which you should set to the RoomPart
(such as a wall) where the object should be described; and specialDesc,
which is the description to show when the room part is examined.
Alternatively (or in addition), you can define
initNominalRoomPartLocation and initSpecialDesc - these work the same
way, but will only be in effect until the object is moved.
