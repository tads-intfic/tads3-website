A "multi-instance" object is a simple way of creating copies of an
object in several places. This is often useful for decorations and other
features that recur in a whole group of rooms.

You define a multi-instance object in two parts.

First, you define a MultiInstance object, which is just a hollow shell
of an object that sets up the location relationships. This shell object
doesn't have any presence in the game world; it's just a programming
abstraction.

Second, as part of the shell object, you define an example of the object
that will actually show up in the game in each of the multiple
locations. You do this by defining a nested object under the
'instanceObject' property of the shell object. This is otherwise a
perfectly ordinary object. In most cases, you'll want to make this a
Decoration, Fixture, or some other non-portable object class, since the
"cloned" nature of these objects means that you usually won't want them
moving around (if they did, you might run into situations where you had
several of them in the same place, leading to disambiguation headaches
for the player).

Here's an example of how you set up a multi-instance object:

trees: MultiInstance  
locationList = \[forest1, forest2, forest3\]  
instanceObject: Fixture { 'tree/trees' 'trees'  
"Many tall, old trees grow here. "  
isPlural = true  
}  
;

Note that the instanceObject itself has no location, because it doesn't
appear in the game-world model itself - it's just a template for the
real objects.

During initialization, the library will automatically create several
instances (i.e., subclasses) of the example object - one instance per
location, to be exact. These instances are the real objects that show up
in the game world.

MultiInstance has one more helpful feature: it lets you dynamically
change the set of locations where the instances appear. You do this
using the same interface that you use to move around MultiLoc objects -
moveInto(), moveIntoAdd(), moveOutOf(). When you call these routines on
the MultiInstance shell object, it will add and remove object instances
as needed to keep everything consistent. Thanks to a little manipulation
we do on the instance objects when we set them up, you can also move the
instance objects around directly using moveInto(), and they'll update
the MultiInstance parent to keep its location list consistent.
