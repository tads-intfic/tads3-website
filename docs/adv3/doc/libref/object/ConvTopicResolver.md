A topic resolver specialized for conversational actions (ASK ABOUT, TELL
ABOUT, etc). When we resolve the topic, we'll differentiate the
resolution to differentiate based on the knowledge of the actor who's
performing the command.

`objInConvScope (obj)`

[action.t](../file/action.t.html)\[[6595](../source/action.t.html#6595)\]



Determine if an object is in "conversational" scope - this returns true
if the object is in physical scope or it's known to the actor performing
the command.



<span id="resolveTopic"></span>

`resolveTopic (lst, requiredNum, np)`<span class="rem">OVERRIDDEN</span>

[action.t](../file/action.t.html)\[[6560](../source/action.t.html#6560)\]



Resolve the topic phrase. We'll break up the vocabulary matches into
three sublists: the objects that are either in physical scope or known
to the actor performing the command; objects that the actor considers
likely topics; and everything else.
