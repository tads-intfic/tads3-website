Command ranking criterion. This is used by the CommandRanking class to
represent one criterion for comparing two parse trees.

Rankings are performed in two passes. The first pass is the rough,
qualitative pass, meant to determine if one parse tree has big, obvious
differences from another. In most cases, this means that one tree has a
particular type of problem or special advantage that the other doesn't
have at all.

The second pass is the fine-grained pass. We only reach the second pass
if we can't find any coarse differences on the first rough pass. In most
cases, the second pass compares the magnitude of problems or advantages
to determine if one tree is slightly better than the other.

[parser.t](../file/parser.t.html)\[[5823](../source/parser.t.html#5823)\]



Compare two CommandRanking objects on the basis of this criterion, for
the first, coarse-grained pass. Returns a positive number if a is better
than b, 0 if they're indistinguishable, or -1 if a is worse than b.
