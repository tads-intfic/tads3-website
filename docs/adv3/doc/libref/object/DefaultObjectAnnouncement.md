Default object announcement. We display this announcement whenever the
player leaves out a required object from a command, but the parser is
able to infer which object they must have meant. The parser infers that
an object was intended when a verb requires an object that the player
didn't specify, and there's only one logical choice for the missing
object. We announce our assumption to put it out in the open, to ensure
that the player is immediately alerted if they had something else in
mind.

In English, this type of announcement conventionally consists of simply
the name of the assumed object, in parenthesis and on a line by itself.
In cases where the object role involves a prepositional phrase in the
verb structure, we generally show the preposition before the object
name. This format usually reads intuitively, by combining with the text
just above of the player's own command:

  
\>open  
(the door\>  
You try opening the door, but it seems to be locked. \*.  
\>unlock the door (with the key)
