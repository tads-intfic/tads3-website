Rank by unmatched possessive-qualified phrases. If we have two unknown
phrases, one with a possessive qualifier and one without, and other
things being equal, prefer the one with the possessive qualifier.

We prefer the qualified version because it lets us report a smaller
phrase that we can't match. For example, in X BOB'S WALLET, if we can't
match WALLET all by itself, it's more useful to report that "you see no
wallet" than to report that you see no "bob's wallet", because the
latter incorrectly implies that there might still be a wallet in scope
as long as it's not Bob's we're looking for.

ignore on pass 1 - this only counts if other factors are equal, so we
want to consider all of the other factors on pass 1 before taking this
criterion into account
