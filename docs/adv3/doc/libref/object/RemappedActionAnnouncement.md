Remapped action announcement. This is used when we need to mention a
defaulted or disambiguated object, but the player's original input was
remapped to a different action that rearranges the object roles. In
these cases, rather than just announcing the defaulted object name, we
announce the entire remapped action; we show the full action description
because rearrangement of the object roles usually makes the standard
object-only announcement confusing to read, since it doesn't naturally
fit in as a continuation of what the user typed.

In English, this message is usually shown with the entire verb phrase,
in present participle form ("opening the door"), enclosed in parentheses
and on a line by itself.
