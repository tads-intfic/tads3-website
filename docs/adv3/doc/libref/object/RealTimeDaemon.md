Real-time daemon. This is an event that occurs repeatedly at given
real-time intervals. When a daemon is executed, it is scheduled again
for execution after its real-time interval elapses again. The daemon's
first execution will occur one interval from the time at which the
daemon is created.

If a daemon is executed late (because other, more pressing tasks had to
be completed first, or because the user was busy editing a command line
and the local platform doesn't support real-time command interruptions),
the interval is applied to the time the daemon actually executed, not to
the originally scheduled execution time. For example, if the daemon is
scheduled to run once every minute, but can't run at all for five
minutes because of command editing on a non-interrupting platform, once
it actually does run, it won't run again for (at least) another minute
after that. This means that the daemon will not run five times all at
once when it's finally allowed to run - there's no making up for lost
time.
