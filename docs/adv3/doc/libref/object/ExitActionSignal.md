Exit Action signal. This signal indicates that we're finished with the
execAction portion of processing the command, but we still want to
proceed with the rest of the command as normal. This can be used when a
step in the action processing wants to preempt any of the more default
processing that would normally follow. This skips directly to the
'afterAction' phase of the command.

Note that this doesn't prevent further processing of the same command if
there are multiple objects involved, and it doesn't affect processing of
additional commands on the same command line. If you want to cancel
further iteration of the same command for additional objects, call
gAction.cancelIteration().
