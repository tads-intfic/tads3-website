An InitObject is an object that contains an execute() method that is
executed at the start of the game, before the first command prompt
occurs. In a particular game much the same effect could be achieved by
putting the code in gameMain.showIntro(), but there are occasions when
you might prefer to use InitObject for a particular task, for example:  
  

<table data-border="0" data-cellpadding="0" data-cellspacing="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>

<td>Starting up a Daemon or Fuse, when the InitObject can conveniently
be mixed-in with the Daemon or Fuse to form a single object (as in the
<a href="onetimepromptdaemon.html">OneTimePromptDaemon</a> example
above).  <br />

be far more convenient than placing it in a game-specific
gameMain.showIntro() method.  <br />
</td>

Some control is possible over the order of execution of InitObjects by
stipulating a list of InitObjects that must be executed before the
current one in the execBeforeMe property, and a list of InitObjects that
must be executed after the current one in the execAfterMe property (this
mechanism is common to all ModuleExecObjects).  
  
Note that in many cases, however, it may be better to use a
[PreinitObject](preinitobject.html) for most of these purposes. One case
where you *must* use an InitObject rather than a PreinitObject is when
you want the object to set up a Fuse or Daemon. Your code will probably
compile if you do this in a PreinitObject, but you'll find that the Fuse
or Daemon is not actually set up when the game runs. Another case where
you would need to use an InitObject rather than a PreinitObject is where
you want its execute method to randomize something at the beginning of
the game, e.g.:  
  
InitObject  
  execute()  
  {  
     gameMain.villain = rand(moriarty, darthVader, presidentClark, caligula);  
     gameMain.villain.moveIntoForTravel(startRoom);  
  }  
;  
  
Although in this example there'd probably be little reason for not
putting such code in gameMain.showIntro(). This might be different if we
had a class of objects that we wanted to set themselves up in this sort
of manner at the start of the game, e.g.:  
  
class PredatoryMale: Person, InitObject  
  mainTargetOfDesire = nil  
  execute()  
  {  
     mainTargetOfDesire = rand(jane, jill, sandra, mary, virginia);  
  }  
;  
  
The fact that this might allow several predatory males to share the same
main target of desire might not matter in the least in this imaginary
game (although in this case we could have overridden initializeActor to
achieve the same result).
