Y'all - the second-person plural. ("Y'all" isn't exactly standard
English, but it's as close as English comes to having a distinct plural
You, and we had to call this \*something\*.)

By default, we treat Y'all as a synonym for You, since there's rarely
any reason in an IF context to distinguish them. The main value in
natural language is in group conversation, where it can be useful to
clarify whether the speaker is addressing the whole group or just an
individual. In IF, though, this is never ambiguous: the addressee is
either explicitly stated in the command, or it's the player character.
The only thing we could do with a plural is check that the verb agrees
in number, and chastise the player's sloppy grammar if not. But that
would be contrary to our general philosophy that we should be as lax as
we can about the input grammar, to minimize the player's typing
workload. So our advice here is to implement a grammar rule for the
various YOUs that treats all of the second-person pronoun forms as
synonyms for the basic singular YOU.
