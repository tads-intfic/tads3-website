A commLink is a Special that establishes a communications link between
the player character and one or more actors in remote locations.

To activate the commLink with another actor, call
commLink.connectTo(other). To make it a video link as well as an audio
link, call commLink.connectTo(other, true).

To disconnect the call with a specific actor, call
commLink.disconnectFrom(other); to terminate the commLink with all
actors, call commLink.disconnect()
