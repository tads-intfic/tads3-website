Mix-in class to help with inventory management. A BagOfHolding can be
mixed in with a Container (or, less usually, Surface, RearContainer or
Underside) to provide an object which, if held by the player character,
will be used to move objects in the player character's inventory to if
his/her hands become too full to pick up another object.

<span id="affinityFor"></span>

`affinityFor (obj)`

[gadget.t](../file/gadget.t.html)\[[302](../source/gadget.t.html#302)\]



The affinity for this BagOfHolding for obj. This can be used to
determined how 'willing' a particular BagOfHolding is to contain obj. A
value of less than 1 means that the BagOfHolding can't contain obj at
all. The higher the affinity, the better the choice this BagOfHolding is
for obj. The default value is 100, or 0 for a BagOfHolding's affinity
for itself.



<span id="moveAction"></span>

`moveAction ( )`

[gadget.t](../file/gadget.t.html)\[[418](../source/gadget.t.html#418)\]



The action needed to move an object into me.



<span id="suitabilityFor"></span>

`suitabilityFor (obj)`

[gadget.t](../file/gadget.t.html)\[[312](../source/gadget.t.html#312)\]



To be suitable to contain obj a BagOfHolding must have enough spare
capacity for it. If it has, its suitability is its affinity for obj;
otherwise it's 0. A BagOfHolding is also unsuitable if it's locked.



<span id="tryHolding"></span>

`tryHolding (obj)`

[gadget.t](../file/gadget.t.html)\[[327](../source/gadget.t.html#327)\]



Class method to determine whether the actor is carrying a suitable
BagOfHolding that could be used to move something from his inventory

appropriate bag of holding.
