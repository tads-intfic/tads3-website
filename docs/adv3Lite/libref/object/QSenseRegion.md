This Special redefines canHear, canSee, canSmell, canTalkTo and
canThrowTo to take account of possible sensory connections across rooms
in a SenseRegion

`active`<span class="rem">OVERRIDDEN</span>

[senseRegion.t](../file/senseRegion.t.html)\[[1388](../source/senseRegion.t.html#1388)\]



This Special should be active whenever this module is included.



<span id="priority"></span>

`priority`<span class="rem">OVERRIDDEN</span>

[senseRegion.t](../file/senseRegion.t.html)\[[1385](../source/senseRegion.t.html#1385)\]



Gives this Special a slightly higher priority than QDefaults, so that it
takes priority.



<span id="_Methods_"></span>



<span class="hdln">Methods</span>  



<span id="canHear"></span>

`canHear (a, b)`

[senseRegion.t](../file/senseRegion.t.html)\[[1440](../source/senseRegion.t.html#1440)\]



Can A hear B? We return true if there's a clear sound path from A to B.



<span id="canSee"></span>

`canSee (a, b)`

[senseRegion.t](../file/senseRegion.t.html)\[[1395](../source/senseRegion.t.html#1395)\]



Can A see B? We return true if and only if B is in light and there's a
clear sight path from A to B.



<span id="canSmell"></span>

`canSmell (a, b)`

[senseRegion.t](../file/senseRegion.t.html)\[[1485](../source/senseRegion.t.html#1485)\]



Can A smell B? We return true if there's a clear scent path from A to B.



<span id="canTalkTo"></span>

`canTalkTo (a, b)`

[senseRegion.t](../file/senseRegion.t.html)\[[1531](../source/senseRegion.t.html#1531)\]



For A to be able to talk to B, A must both be able to hear B and either
be in the same room as B or in a room that's close enough to be able to
converse with B



<span id="canThrowTo"></span>

`canThrowTo (a, b)`

[senseRegion.t](../file/senseRegion.t.html)\[[1554](../source/senseRegion.t.html#1554)\]



Can A throw an object to B?



<span id="nonBlocker"></span>

`nonBlocker (o, b)`

[senseRegion.t](../file/senseRegion.t.html)\[[1601](../source/senseRegion.t.html#1601)\]



Is o the kind of object that would block movement from one room to the
room containing b? It is unless o is a room and the room and b are both
in a SenseRegion for which autoGoTo is true.



<span id="reachBlocker"></span>

`reachBlocker (a, b)`

[senseRegion.t](../file/senseRegion.t.html)\[[1582](../source/senseRegion.t.html#1582)\]



Determine if A can reach B, and if not, what stands in the way. Returns
a list of containers along the path between A and B that obstruct the
reach. If the two objects are in separate rooms, the top-level room
containing A is in the list to represent the room separation. If there's
no obstruction, we return an empty list.
