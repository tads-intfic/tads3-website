Us - the first-person plural. We throw this one in for relative
completeness, but we simply treat it as a synonym for Me. This could be
useful in a game with a PC that represents a group of people (an
adventuring party in a hack-n-slash game, say), or a royal personage.

A more sophisticated use would be to allow the player to refer
collectively to the PC and a group of accompanying NPCs. The base
library doesn't implement this because it doesn't define a way to
identify such a group, but a game could add that capability. Once you've
defined what US means, you could make the pronoun US bind to that group
simply by modifying the resolve() method here.
