A TravelAction is one that moves (or at least tries to move) the player
character from one place to another via a command like GO NORTH, or
EAST.

<span id="_Properties_"></span>



<span class="hdln">Properties</span>  



<span id="baseActionClass"></span>

`baseActionClass`

[action.t](../file/action.t.html)\[[1184](../source/action.t.html#1184)\]



*no description available*



<span id="canUndo"></span>

`canUndo`

[action.t](../file/action.t.html)\[[1533](../source/action.t.html#1533)\]



It's generally possible to undo a travel command.



<span id="direction"></span>

`direction`

[action.t](../file/action.t.html)\[[1530](../source/action.t.html#1530)\]



The direction the actor wants to travel in. This is placed here by the
execCycle method and takes the form of A Direction object, e.g.
northDir.



<span id="predefinedDirection"></span>

`predefinedDirection`

[action.t](../file/action.t.html)\[[1214](../source/action.t.html#1214)\]



Does this TravelAction already define a set direction on its direction
property (so we don't need to look to what direction object the command
refers)?



<span id="_Methods_"></span>



<span class="hdln">Methods</span>  



<span id="doTravel"></span>

`doTravel ( )`

[action.t](../file/action.t.html)\[[1299](../source/action.t.html#1299)\]



Carry out travel in direction. For this purpose we first have to define
what the corresponding direction property of the actor's current
location refers to. If it's nil, no travel is possible, and we simply
display a refusal message. If it's an object we execute its travelVia()
method for the current actor. If it's a double-quoted string or a method
we execute it and make a note of where the actor ends up, if the actor
is the player character. If it's a single-quoted string we display it.

Note that we only display the various messages announcing failure of
travel if the actor is the player character. We presumably don't want to
see these messages as the result of NPCs trying to move around the map.



<span id="execAction"></span>

`execAction (cmd)`<span class="rem">OVERRIDDEN</span>

[action.t](../file/action.t.html)\[[1220](../source/action.t.html#1220)\]



Execute the travel command, first carrying out any implicit actions
needed to facilitate travel



<span id="execCycle"></span>

`execCycle (cmd)`<span class="rem">OVERRIDDEN</span>

[action.t](../file/action.t.html)\[[1190](../source/action.t.html#1190)\]



Use the inherited handling but first make a note of the direction the
actor wants to travel in.
