A Signal is a kind of Relation that can be used to send a signal from a
sender to all the objects related to that sender via this Signal
Relation.

For a signal to be sent from a sender to a receiver, a relationship
first needs to be set up between them with a statement like:

connect(sender, signal, receiver);

Where signal is either the programmatic name or the string name of the
signal we want sent.

To break the link subsequently we can use:

unconnect(sender, signal, receiver);

`dispatchTab`

[signals.t](../file/signals.t.html)\[[99](../source/signals.t.html#99)\]



A LookupTable liniking objects that might emit this signal (potential
senders) to potential receivers of this signal, so that notifications
can be sent from the former to the latter. Game code should not need to
manipulate this table directly; it should instead be updated via the
supplied connect() and unconnect() functions.

`emit (sender, [args])`

[signals.t](../file/signals.t.html)\[[46](../source/signals.t.html#46)\]



Notify every object related to sender by us to handle us as a signal
from sender.

If additional args are supplied, they can take one of two forms. Either
values, which are then assigned in turn to the properties listed in our
propList property, or two-element lists of the form \[prop, val\] where
prop is a property pointer and val is the value to be assigned to this
property. Note that these two forms cannot be mixed in the same call to
this method, unless all the list form arguments come at the end.
