`extraScopeItems`

[travel.t](../file/travel.t.html)\[[2113](../source/travel.t.html#2113)\]

`familiar`

[travel.t](../file/travel.t.html)\[[2019](../source/travel.t.html#2019)\]

with, such as the layout of his own house.

`fastGoTo`

[travel.t](../file/travel.t.html)\[[2184](../source/travel.t.html#2184)\]



Should the fastGoTo option be used in this region (i.e. traveling from
one room in the region to another is all done in one turn without the
need for CONTINUE, even if several steps are involved)? Note that the
value of this setting has no effect if gameMain.fastGoTo is true, since
then the fastGoTo setting is always in effect.



<span id="regions"></span>

[travel.t](../file/travel.t.html)\[[1946](../source/travel.t.html#1946)\]



This region can optionally be in one or more regions. The regions

`rooms`

[travel.t](../file/travel.t.html)\[[1996](../source/travel.t.html#1996)\]

`addToContents (obj, vec?)`

[travel.t](../file/travel.t.html)\[[2047](../source/travel.t.html#2047)\]



To add an object to our contents we need to add it to the contents of
every room in this region. If the optional vec parameter is supplied it
must be a vector; the rooms will then be added to the vector as well.
The vec parameter is primarily for use by the MultiLoc class.



<span id="addToRoomList"></span>

[travel.t](../file/travel.t.html)\[[2074](../source/travel.t.html#2074)\]



Add an additional room (passed as the rm parameter) to our list of
rooms. This method is intended for internal library use at PreInit only.

A list of all the regions this Region is within; in addition to any
regions this Region is directly in (defined on its regions property)
this will include all the regions it's indirectly in (i.e. any regions
the regions it's in are in and so forth).



<span id="isCurrentlyWithin"></span>

`isCurrentlyWithin (region)`

[dynamicRegion.t](../file/dynamicRegion.t.html)\[[184](../source/dynamicRegion.t.html#184)\]

A Room can't be in another Room or a Thing, but it can notionally be in
a Region, so we check to see if we're in the list of our regions.

*Modified in
[dynamicRegion.t](../file/dynamicRegion.t.html)\[[158](../source/dynamicRegion.t.html#158)\]:*  
A DynamicRegion cannot contain other regions \[DYNAMIC REGION
