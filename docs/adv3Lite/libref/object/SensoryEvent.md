`notifyProp`

[sensory.t](../file/sensory.t.html)\[[484](../source/sensory.t.html#484)\]



A property pointer to the property on each notified object that needs to
be executed when it's notified of this SensoryEvent (e.g.
&notifySoundEvent). \[DEFINED IN SENSORY EXTENSION\]

`remoteProp`

[sensory.t](../file/sensory.t.html)\[[498](../source/sensory.t.html#498)\]



The property pointer to the property of Room defining which list of
rooms also needs to be checked for remote items that might sense this
