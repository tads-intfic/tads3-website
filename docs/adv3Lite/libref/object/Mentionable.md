<span id="_Properties_"></span>



<span class="hdln">Properties</span>  



<span id="ambiguouslyPlural"></span>

`ambiguouslyPlural`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[228](../source/thing.t.html#228)\]



Some objects, such as a pair of shoes or a flight of stairs could be
regarded as either singular or plural and referred to as either 'it' or
'them'. Set ambiguouslyPlural to true for such objects.



<span id="disambigGroup"></span>

`disambigGroup`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[86](../source/thing.t.html#86)\]



Disambiguation prompt grouping. When the parser generates a
disambiguation question ("Which did you mean, the red book, or the blue
book?"), it'll group the objects in the list by common disambigGroup
values. The group is just an arbitrary value that keeps like objects
together in the list. You can use a string, a class, or whatever you
like for this, as long as grouped objects have the same value in common.
We give this property a default value of 0 so that the disambigOrder
will work by default without the need to specify a disambigGroup.



<span id="disambigMatchPhrases"></span>

`disambigMatchPhrases`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[618](../source/thing.t.html#618)\]



Do we want to test for phrase matches when disambiguating? We'll assume
that by default we do since the same reasons for wanting the phrase
match are likely to apply when disambiguating, and that we'll use the
same set of phrases. This can be overridden to supply a different set of
phrases or none.



<span id="disambigName"></span>

`disambigName`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[73](../source/thing.t.html#73)\]



The object's disambiguation name. This is a more detailed version of the
name, for situations where the short name is ambiguous. For example, the
parser displays this name in "Which do you mean" questions when it would
help tell two of the listed objects apart.

By default, this is the same as the short name. It's uncommon to
override this, since short names are typically already detailed enough
for most purposes. Every so often, though, you'll want to keep the short
name very terse, so you'll leave out some distinguishing detail that it
\*could\* have had. In such cases, you can add the distinguishing detail
here, so that it's displayed only when it's really needed.



<span id="disambigOrder"></span>

`disambigOrder`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[103](../source/thing.t.html#103)\]



Disambiguation prompt sorting. This gives the display order of this item
within its disambiguation group, if it has one. The parser sorts objects
within each group in ascending order of this value when generating the
object list for a disambiguation question. This is simply an integer;
the default is 1 for every object, which makes the ordering arbitrary.

This property is useful for grouped objects with a natural ordering,
such as items with sequential labels of some sort (numbers, letters,
etc). You can use this property to ensure that lists of these items will
be displayed in the natural order: "button 1, button 2, or button 3?" or
"the door on the left, the door in the middle, or the door on the
right?"



<span id="distinguishByContents"></span>

`distinguishByContents`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[272](../source/thing.t.html#272)\]



Can I be distinguished in parser messages by my contents? If so, we can
be distinguished (in parser messages) from similar objects by our
contents, or lack thereof: "bucket of water" vs "empty bucket". If this
is true, our nominalContents property determines the contents we display
for this.



<span id="isHer"></span>

`isHer`<span class="rem">OVERRIDDEN</span>

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[204](../source/thing.t.html#204)\]



*no description available*



<span id="isHim"></span>

`isHim`<span class="rem">OVERRIDDEN</span>

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[203](../source/thing.t.html#203)\]



*no description available*



<span id="isIt"></span>

`isIt`<span class="rem">OVERRIDDEN</span>

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[202](../source/thing.t.html#202)\]



The object's grammatical gender(s). This information is used to
determine which pronouns can match the object as an antecedent, which
pronouns should represent it in output, and (for some languages) which
articles and other gender-agreement words should be used in conjunction
with the object name in output.

The default is neuter. Use isHim and isHer to give an object masculine
and/or feminine gender. Use isIt to explicitly give an object neuter
gender. By default, we infer isIt from isHim and isHer: we assume the
object is neuter if it's not masculine or feminine.

Languages that have grammatical gender will almost certainly want to
parse articles in the 'vocab' property to make it more convenient to
encode each object's gender. For example, a French implementation could
parse 'le' or 'la' at the start of a vocab string and set isHim and
isHer accordingly.

The English library sets isHim and isHer if 'him' and 'her'
(respectively) are found in the object's pronoun list. (This is the most
convenient way to represent gender via the vocab string in English,
since English doesn't have gendered articles.)

Note that we define the genders as three separate properties, so the
genders are NOT mutually exclusive - an object can be a "him", a "her",
and an "it" at the same time. This is because a single object can have
multiple grammatical genders in some languages. In English, for example,
an animal can be referred to as gendered (matching its physical gender)
or neuter; and a few inanimate objects have a sort of optional,
idiomatic gender, such as referring to a ship or country as "her".

Some languages might need additional genders. When needed, LMentionable
should simply define suitable additional properties.

In most gendered languages, the grammatical gender is an attribute of
the noun, not of the object. In particular, if an object has two nouns
in its vocabulary, the two nouns might be of different genders. The
language module might therefore limit the use of isIt et al to the
gender of the object's name string as it appears in output (e.g., for
selecting an article when showing the name in a list, or selecting a
pronoun to represent the object), and use a completely different scheme
to tag the gender of individual vocabulary words. One approach would be
to use separate mNoun and fNoun token properties (and more if needed) to
distinguish the gender of individual nouns in the dictionary.



<span id="massNoun"></span>

`massNoun`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[247](../source/thing.t.html#247)\]



The object's name is a mass noun. A mass noun is a word that has
singular form but represents an indeterminate quantity or group of
something, such as "sand" or "furniture".

In English, mass nouns use "some" as the indefinite article rather than
"a" (some sand, not a sand). Their plural usage tends to differ from
regular nouns, in that they already carry a sense of plurality; if you
have two distinct piles of sand, the two together are usually still just
"sand", not "two sands".

When a mass noun is awkward as an object's name, you can often make it
into a regular noun by naming its overall form. "Sand" is a mass noun,
but recasting it as "pile of sand" makes it an ordinary noun. (The
generic way to do this for a homogeneous substance is to add "quantity
of".)



<span id="matchPhrases"></span>

`matchPhrases`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[608](../source/thing.t.html#608)\]



A single-quoted string, or a list of single-quoted strings containing
exact phrases (i.e. sequences of words) that must be matched by the
player input if any of the words in the phrase matches appear in the
player input. Note that words defined here should also be defined in the
vocab property; the purpose of the matchPhrases property is to limit
matches. Note also that object will be matched if any of the phrases in
the list is matched.



<span id="matchPhrasesExclude"></span>

`matchPhrasesExclude`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[626](../source/thing.t.html#626)\]



If failing to match any of the match phrases (when the player's input
includes at least one word used in any of them) excludes a match, then
return nil



<span id="name"></span>

`name`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[37](../source/thing.t.html#37)\]



The object's short name, for display in lists and announcements. By
default, this is automatically derived from 'vocab', so you usually
don't have to set it directly. If you define a non-nil 'name' value
manually, though, it takes precedence (i.e., the library won't replace
it with the name implied by 'vocab').



<span id="nominalContents"></span>

`nominalContents`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[263](../source/thing.t.html#263)\]



My nominal contents is the special contents item we can use in naming
the object. This is useful for containers whose identities come
primarily from their contents, such as a vessel for liquids or a box of
loose files. Returns an object that qualifies the name: a "water" object
for BOX OF WATER, a "files" object for BOX OF FILES. Nil means that the
object isn't named by its contents.

Note that this is always a single object (or nil), not the whole list of
contents. We can only be named by one content object. (So you can't have
a "box of books and papers" by having separate nominal contents objects
for the books and the papers; although you could fake it by creating a
"books and papers" object.)



<span id="person"></span>

`person`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[152](../source/thing.t.html#152)\]



The grammatical person of narration relative to this object. Use 1 for
first person ("I am in a cave"), 2 for second person ("You are in a
cave"), and 3 for third person ("Bob is in a cave").

Usually, every object in the game will be in the third person -
\*except\* the player character object, which is usually in the second
person. The library doesn't care which person you use for the player
character, though - you're free to use first or third person if you
prefer. First-person and third-person IF are relatively uncommon, but
not unheard of.

This property is used for verb agreement when library messages are
generated. This ensures that library messages adapt to the correct
narrative person of the story automatically. To write a first-person
game, you don't have to replace all of the default messages, but simply
set person=1 in your PC object.



<span id="plural"></span>

`plural`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[221](../source/thing.t.html#221)\]



The object's name's grammatical number. This specifies singular or
plural usage for the object's name when it appears in generated
messages. By default, an object has singular usage, so it'll appear as
(for example) "an orange". Some objects have names with plural usage,
either because they're words that always appear in the plural (such as
"scissors"), or because the game object represents a group of items that
are too numerous and unimportant to the game to actually implement as
separate Thing objects. For example, the books in a library might be
implemented collectively as a single "books" object.

The English library sets this to true if 'them' is listed as a pronoun
for the object in the 'vocab' property.



<span id="proper"></span>

`proper`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[123](../source/thing.t.html#123)\]



Is this object's short name a proper name? A proper name is the name of
a person, place, or other unique entity with its own name.

This property controls how the library shows the object's name in
generated messages. In English, for example, articles (a, the) aren't
used with a proper name.

The English library tries to infer whether the object has a proper name
based on the 'vocab' string: if all the words in the short name are
capitalized, we'll consider it a proper name. This rule of thumb doesn't
always apply, though, so you can override it: simply set 'proper'
explicitly in an individual object, and the setting will take precedence
over whatever the name's capitalization would otherwise imply. (Other
languages might have different rules for inferring 'proper', and some
might not be able to infer it at all.)



<span id="qualified"></span>

`qualified`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[132](../source/thing.t.html#132)\]



The object's name is "qualified" grammatically, meaning that it can't be
combined with articles (a, the) or possessives. Proper names are
considered to be qualified, but it's possible for a name to be qualified
but not proper, such as a name that incorporates a possessive.



<span id="roomTitle"></span>

`roomTitle`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[57](../source/thing.t.html#57)\]



My room title. This is displayed as the start of the room headline,
which is the first line of the room description when 'self' is the
outermost visible container of the point-of-view actor. The headline is
also conventionally shown on the status line whenever the player is in
the location.

The room title essentially serves as a label for the room on the
player's mental and/or paper map of the game's geography. It's usually
something short and pithy that sums up the room's essence, function, or
appearance, and is usually written in title case: Ice Cave, Bank Lobby,
Front of House, Transporter Room 3, etc.

The room headline sometimes adds more status information to the title,
such as the point-of-view actor's direct container when the actor is
inside an intermediate container within the room, such as a chair.



<span id="states"></span>

`states`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[655](../source/thing.t.html#655)\]



the State objects applying to this object



<span id="vocab"></span>

`vocab`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[28](../source/thing.t.html#28)\]



'vocab' is a string that we use to initialize the object's short name,
dictionary words, grammatical gender, and grammatical number
(singular/plural). This is designed to make it as convenient as possible
to describe the object's name and grammatical behavior for input and
output purposes.

The syntax is language-specific - see initVocab() for details.



<span id="vocabWords"></span>

`vocabWords`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[652](../source/thing.t.html#652)\]



Vocabulary word list. This is a vector of VocabWord objects that we
build in initVocab(), giving the individual words that this object uses
for its noun phrase vocabulary.



<span id="_Methods_"></span>



<span class="hdln">Methods</span>  



<span id="construct"></span>

`construct ( )`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[634](../source/thing.t.html#634)\]



On dynamically creating a new object, do the automatic vocabulary and
short name initialization.



<span id="filterResolveList"></span>

`filterResolveList (np, cmd, mode)`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[672](../source/thing.t.html#672)\]



The filterResolveList method allows this object to remove itself or
other objects from the list of resolved objects.

np is the noun phrase, so np.matches gives the current list of matches,
and np.matches\[i\].obj gives the ith object match. To change the list
of matches, manipulate the np.matches list.

cmd is the command object, so that cmd.action gives the action about to
be executed.

mode is the match mode.

By default we do nothing here.



<span id="matchName"></span>

`matchName (tokens)`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[313](../source/thing.t.html#313)\]



Match the object to a noun phrase in the player's input. If the given
token list is a valid name for this object, we return a combination of
MatchXxx flag values describing the match. If the token list isn't a
valid name for this object, we return 0.

By default, we call simpleMatchName(), which matches the name if all of
the words in the token list are in the object's vocabulary list,
regardless of word order.

In most cases, an unordered word match works just fine. The obvious
drawback with this approach is that it's far too generous at matching
nonsense phrases to object names - DUSTY OLD SPELL BOOK and BOOK DUSTY
SPELL OLD are treated the same. In most cases, users won't enter
nonsense phrases like that anyway, so they'll probably never notice that
we accept them. If they enter something like that intentionally, we can
plead Garbage In/Garbage Out: a user who willfully types a nonsense
command has only himself to blame for a nonsense reply.

Occasionally, though, there are reasons to be pickier. When these come
up, you can override matchName() to be as picky as you like.

The most common situation where pickiness is called for is when two
objects happen to share some of the same vocabulary words, but certain
words orderings clearly refer to only one or the other. With the
unordered approach, this can be a nuisance for the player because it can
trigger disambiguation questions that seem unnecessary. Overriding
matchName() to be picky about word order for those specific objects can
often fix this. In this implementation the matchPhrases property can be
used for this purpose.

Another example is ensuring the user knows the correct full name of an
object as part of a puzzle: you can override matchName() to make sure
the user doesn't accidentally stumble on the object by using one of its
vocabulary words to refer to something else nearby. Another example is
matching words that aren't in the vocabulary list, such as a game object
that represents a group of apparent objects that have a whole range of
labels ("post office box 123", say).



<span id="matchNameCommon"></span>

`matchNameCommon (tokens, phrases, excludes)`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[325](../source/thing.t.html#325)\]



Match a name against a list of tokens entered by the player. phrases is
the list of match phrases defined on the object (either for initial
matching or for disambiguation) and excludes should be true or nil
depending on whether failure to match phrases should exclude a match
overall.



<span id="matchNameDisambig"></span>

`matchNameDisambig (tokens)`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[418](../source/thing.t.html#418)\]



Match the object to a noun phrase in \*disambiguation\* input. This
checks words in the player's reply to a "Which one did you mean...?"
question from the parser. When the player replies to this kind of
question, they usually don't respond with the full name, but with just
an adjective or two.

Now, you might think we should handle these replies by just appending
them to the original noun phrase in the input. But we can't just do
that: matchName() \*could\* care about the order of the words in the
noun phrase, so we can't just assume that we can stick them in somewhere
and still have a valid name for the object. So, instead of doing that,
we call this routine with the phrase from the player's answer to the
"Which one" question. Since this routine knows that the new words aren't
part of the original phrase, it can deal with them as it sees fit with
respect to word order.

The default here, of course, is to do the same thing as the default
matchName(): we simply call simpleMatchName() to match the input to the
object vocabulary, ignoring word order. This will usually work even when
matchName() is overridden to care about word order, since the added
words here are just serving to distinguish one object from another.

`phraseMatchName (phrases, tokens)`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[541](../source/thing.t.html#541)\]



If we have any phraseMatches defined, check whether we fail to match any
of them. This will be the case if we find a phraseMatch containing one
of our tokens but not the rest in the right order.



<span id="simpleMatchName"></span>

`simpleMatchName (tokens)`

[thing.t](../file/thing.t.html)\[[438](../source/thing.t.html#438)\]



Simple implementation of matchName(), which simply checks to see if all
of the tokens are associated with the object. The "simple" aspect is
that we don't pay any attention to the order of the words - we simply
check that they're all in the object's vocabulary list, in any order.
