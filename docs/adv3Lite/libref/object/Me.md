Me - the first-person singular. ME always binds to the player character.

The discussion about the validity of binding YOU to the PC applies in
mirror image here. In a second-person game, the PC is the narrator's YOU
and the player's ME; in a first-person game, she's the narrator's ME and
the player's YOU. But there is no game-world object for ME to bind to in
commands in a first-person game - if anything, ME would be the player
(not the player character, but the actual player), who is clearly not a
game-world entity. Since that's not meaningful, we can assume that a
player talking about ME in a first-person game is being literal-minded
and just using the same pronouns the narrator does, or that they're so
accustomed to the second-person convention of most IF that they're
saying ME out of habit. In either case, the PC is the one they're
talking about.
