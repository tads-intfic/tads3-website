The relations.t extension allows Inform7-style relations to be defined
in a TADS 3 game.

`relate (a, rel, b)`

[relations.t](../file/relations.t.html)\[[503](../source/relations.t.html#503)\]



Make a related to b via the rel relation. The rel parameter can be
specified either as an object (in which case its the relevant relation
object) or as a single-quoted string (in which cast it's either the name
or the reverseName of a relation object.

`related (a, rel, b?)`

[relations.t](../file/relations.t.html)\[[578](../source/relations.t.html#578)\]



If two arguments are supplied (e.g. related(a, knows)) returns a list of
items related to a via the rel relation. If three arguments are supplied
(e.g. related(a, knows, b)) then return true if a is related to b via
the knows relation and b otherwise.

<span id="relationPath"></span>

`relationPath (start, rel, target)`

[relations.t](../file/relations.t.html)\[[753](../source/relations.t.html#753)\]



Find a path from start to target via the rel relation, where rel can be
a single relation or a list of relations, and can be specified either
via a relation object name or a string name (or reverseName). We provide
this as a convenient wrapper for the more verbose method call.

<span id="unrelate"></span>

`unrelate (a, rel, b)`

[relations.t](../file/relations.t.html)\[[539](../source/relations.t.html#539)\]



Remove the rel relation between a and b
