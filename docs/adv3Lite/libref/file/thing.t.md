Mentionable is the base class for objects that the player can refer to
in command input. In order for the parser to recognize an object, the
object must have vocabulary words in the dictionary. This class's main
function, then, is to set up the dictionary for an object, so that its
words are recognizable to the parser.

This class is based on LMentionable, which is defined in the language
module. LMentionable provides implementations for certain methods that
we rely upon for functionality that varies by language.
