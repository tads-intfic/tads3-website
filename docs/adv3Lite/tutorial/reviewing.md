# Chapter 4: Reviewing the Basics

In the previous chapter we went through creating a game together and
made use of all sorts of adv3Lite (and TADS 3) features without really

[Object Containment](containment.html)  
[Methods, Functions and Statements](methods.html)  
[Inheritance, Modification and Overriding](inherit.html)  
[Things in Quotes](quotes.html)
