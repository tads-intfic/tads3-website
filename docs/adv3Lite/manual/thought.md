# Thoughts

The thoughts.t module provides a framework for responding to commands of
the form THINK ABOUT WHATEVER. It uses precisely the same TopicEntry
mechanism as the Consultable/ConsultTopic classes, and can be used in
almost precisely the same way. All you need to do is to define an object
of the **ThoughtManager** class and then populate it with **Thought**
objects, like so:

```
    myThoughts: ThoughtManager
    ;

    + Thought @george
        "To be honest, you're not really sure what he's doing here. "
    ;

    + Thought @tFire
        "It's a wretched nuiscance. Your nephew's probably to blame for it
        somehow, but the important thing right now is just to escape from it. "
    ;

    + DefaultThought
        "You find your thoughts start to wander; for some reason you can't
        concentrate on that topic right now. "
    ;
```

Thought inherits from [TopicEntry](topicentry.html), so you can use all
the properties and methods of TopicEntry with it; Thought and
DefaultThought work just like ConsultTopic and DefaultConsultTopic.

You can exclude thoughts.t if you don't want to implement a THINK ABOUT
command (or you don't want to implement it this way), but if you include
thoughts.t you must also include topicentry.t.
