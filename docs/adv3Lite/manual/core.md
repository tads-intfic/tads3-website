# Part II: The Core Library

This part describes the main classes contained in the core library. If
you're new to adv3Lite you may want to master this material before
trying to get to grips with other topics. Some more complex aspects of
the Core Library, such as the command execution cycle, are left until
later. Here we cover the basic fundamentals of what you need to know to
write a simple TADS 3 game with adv3Lite.

Some aspects of the core library, such as actions and startup and ending
code will be dealt with in later sections.
