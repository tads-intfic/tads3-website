# Events

The Events module implements Daemons and Fuses. A
<span id="fuse_idx">Fuse</span> is something that causes a piece of code
to execute after a set number of turns. A Daemon is something that
causes a piece of code to be executed every turn or every so many turns.
Daemons and Fuses in adv3Lite are very similar to those in adv3.

To create set up a fuse, just create a new Fuse object thus:

<span class="synLit">new
Fuse(</span><span class="synPar">obj</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">prop</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">turns</span>

<span class="synLit">)</span>

This defines a Fuse that will call `obj.(prop)`,
i.e. the prop method of obj, after *turns* turns. If *turns* is 0 then
the Fuse will execute on the same turn.

For example, to define an alarm clock that rings in 10 turns' time after
you push a button on it, we could define:

```
    alarmClock: Thing 'alarm clock'
        "It has a big red button attached. "
        
        ring() 
        {
           "The alarm clock starts ringing loudly. ";
           redButton.isDown = nil;
        }
    ;

    + redButton: Component 'big red button'
        dobjFor(Push)
        {
            verify()
            { 
                if(isDown)
                   illogicalNow('The button is already down. ');
            }
          
            action()
            {
                isDown = true;
                "You push the red button down. ";
                new Fuse(alarmClock, &ring, 10);
            }
        }
       
       isDown = nil
    ;
```

Note, by the way, that the property we want to execute has to be listed
in the arguments to `new Fuse` as a property
*pointer*, with an ampersand (&) immediately preceding its name.

A <span id="daemon-idx">Daemon</span> is defined in exactly the same
way, except that instead of only executing once, it will execute every
*turns* turns. If *turns* is given as zero, then the Daemon will execute
on the current turn (i.e. after zero turns) and then every turn
thereafter (until it is removed).

It's sometimes useful to store a reference to a Daemon so we can turn it
off again:

<span class="synPar">daemonID</span><span class="synLit"> = new
Daemon(</span><span class="synPar">obj</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">prop</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">turns</span>

<span class="synLit">)</span>

It may be, though, that the player character won't be around to see (or
hear, or smell) the event that the Fuse or Daemon is reporting, in which
case we'd ideally like to suppress any text that the Fuse or Daemon
would otherwise display. We can do that using a **SenseFuse** or
**SenseDaemon**. These can be created in exactly the same way as a
normal Fuse or Daemon but any text they would otherwise display won't be
displayed unless the player character can see the object passed as the
*obj* parameter when the SenseFuse or SenseDaemon is created.

Occasionally this may not be what we want, since we want to test whether
the object in question can be smelled or heard rather than seen. Or it
may be that we want to test the visibility or audibility of some object
other than the one we passed as the *obj* parameter, other, that is,
than the object whose *prop* method the Fuse or Daemon is executing. In
such a case we can define the Fuse or Daemon with one or two additional
parameters:

<span class="synLit">new
<span id="sensefuse-idx">SenseFuse</span>(</span><span class="synPar">obj</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">prop</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">turns</span><span class="synMark">\[,
senseProp, senseObj\]</span>

<span class="synLit">)</span>

<span class="synLit">new
<span id="sensedaemon">SenseDaemon</span>(</span><span class="synPar">obj</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">prop</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">turns</span><span class="synMark">\[,
senseProp, senseObj\]</span>

<span class="synLit">)</span>

Where *senseProp* must be one of &canSee, &canHear or &canSmell (or
conceivably &canReach) and *senseObj* is the object that must be sensed
appropriately. Note that you can just supply the *senseProp* parameter
if you want to test whether *obj* can be heard or smelled, but that if
you supply the *senseObj* parameter you have to supply the *senseProp*
parameter as well.

<span id="promptdaemon"></span>

Finally, you can define a **PromptDaemon** which executes just before
the command prompt on every turn:

<span class="synLit">new
PromptDaemon(</span><span class="synPar">obj</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">prop</span>

<span class="synLit">)</span>

There is also a **OneTimePromptDaemon** which, as its name suggests, is
a PromptDaemon that executes only once (effectively a PromptFuse, though
the adv3Lite library keeps the same name for this class as the adv3
library).

You may wish to stop a Daemon, or prevent a Fuse from executing before
its due to fire. If you've stored a reference to the Fuse or Daemon you
can disable it by calling its **removeEvent()** method, e.g.:

```
      daemonID.removeEvent();
```

If you haven't stored a reference to the Fuse or Daemon you want to
remove, you can remove it by calling:

<span class="synLit">eventManager.removeMatchingEvents(</span><span class="synPar">obj</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">prop</span><span class="synLit">)</span>

Where *obj* and *prop* are the object and property for which the Fuse or
Daemon was originally created.

Finally, you can control the order in which Fuses and Daemons are
processed by overriding their **eventOrder** property. The higher the
`eventOrder`, the later the event; the default
value of `eventOrder` is 100. This doesn't
effect `PromptDaemons` which are always
displayed just before the command prompt. Note that while other Fuses
and Daemons may not be executed if the turn cycle is interrupted (by an
`abort` statement, for example), PromptDaemons
are always executed.
