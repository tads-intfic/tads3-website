<p>Lockable is a mix-in class that must be used with other classes such as
<a href="door.html">Door</a> or Openable, but even when mixed-in the Lockable class
doesn’t really do much, as we saw in the case of the
<a href="lockablecontainer.html">LockableContainer</a>, since it simply allows
something to be locked and unlocked via LOCK and UNLOCK commands, which
are carried out implicitly if the player tries to open whatever it is
that’s locked.</p>

<p>You can verify this by modifying both sides of the door into and out of
the lakeRoom:</p>

<p>+ lakeDoor : <strong>Lockable</strong>, Door ’door’ ’door’;</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>+ lakeDoor2 : <strong>Lockable</strong>, Door -&gt;lakeDoor ’door’ ’door’;</p>

<p>If you compile and run the game and try to go south through this door
from anotherCave you’ll find the lock doesn’t prove much of a barrier.
The only reason to use plain vanilla Lockable with a Door is if the
other side of the door is going to be locked by some less plain vanilla
means, which is what we’ll go on to do. This could represent a situation
like a front door, say, which is locked and unlocked by a key on the
outside and a simple knob on the inside. Locking the door on the inside
would then prevent pursuit by an Actor who did not have the key.</p>

<p>There are a number of properties and methods on the Lockable class, the
most useful of which for game authors are:</p>

<table data-border="0" data-cellpadding="0" data-cellspacing="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr data-valign="top">
<td width="14"><strong></strong>·<strong></strong></td>
<td><strong>autoUnlockOnOpen</strong>: if true the object is
automatically unlocked when someone attempts to open it (or at least,
the parser attempts to unlock it, although the attempt may fail if
there's some reason why the object can't be unlocked). The library
default is to set this to lockStatusObvious (see below).  <br />

<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr data-valign="top">
<td width="14"><strong></strong>·<strong></strong></td>
<td><strong>lockedDesc</strong>: the description to display when the
object is locked or unlocked. The library default is fine for most
situations, but if you want to customize it you need to define the
property in the form lockedDesc = (isLocked() ? messageWhenLocked :
messageWhenUnlocked), where messageWhenLocked and messageWhenUnlocked
are single quoted strings or properties/methods evaluating to single
quoted strings.  <br />

<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr data-valign="top">
<td width="14"><strong></strong>·<strong></strong></td>
<td><strong>lockStatusObvious</strong>: this should be true or nil
depending on whether an actor should be able to tell by simple visual
inspection that the object is locked. The library default is true. For a
<a href="lockablewithkey.html">LockableWithKey</a> (e.g. a door with a
keyhole) it might not be obvious whether the object is locked until the
player tries to open it. In such a case the most desirable behaviour
might be for the game to change lockStatusObvious from nil to true once
the door has been tried; for example you could override cannotUnlockMsg
on the object to include something like '&lt;.reveal door-locked&gt;'
and then set lockStatusObvious = gRevealed('door-locked').  <br />

<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr data-valign="top">
<td width="14"><strong></strong>·<strong></strong></td>
<td><strong>lockStatusReportable</strong>: this is used to decide
whether the parser should report the object as being locked or unlocked.
For example, if an object is open, it is obviously unlocked, so it is
redundant to report something like "The door is red. It's open. It's
unlocked. ", it is sufficient to report "The door is red. It's open. "
The library takes care of this particular case by default, but there may
be other cases where you want to override the library behaviour.  <br />

the result of pushing a button or pulling a lever on an <a href="indirectlockable.html">IndirectLockable</a>). You can also override
this method if you want to produce some additional side-effects of
locking or unlocking the object, but make sure you then call
inherited(stat) somewhere in your makeLocked(stat) method.  <br />

default) then the Lockable object starts out locked, so if we don't want
it to start out locked we need to change this to nil (note that this was
first added to Lockable in TADS 3.0.10)  <br />

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE. Since Lockable is a mix-in class (not derived from
Thing) (1) it cannot be used on its own (you can’t define a physical
object as being simply Lockable, it must be a Lockable something, such
as a Lockable, Container or a Lockable, Door) and (2) it must be listed
<em>before</em> any Thing-derived class it is mixed-in with. Thus whereas the
following works fine:</p>

<p>+ lakeDoor : Lockable, Door ’door’ ’door’;</p>

<p>The following does not:</p>

<p>+ lakeDoor : Door, Lockable  ’door’ ’door’;</p>

<p>The second of these will compile fine, and the door will appear - but
the lock won’t work as expected (for example, even if the
initiallyLocked property is set to true, the door won’t start out
locked).</p>
