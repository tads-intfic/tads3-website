<h1 id="operator-overloading">Operator Overloading</h1>

<p>TADS lets you define custom meanings for many of the “algebraic”
operators when applied to regular objects. This is known as
<em>overloading</em> an operator, because it assigns a meaning to the operator
when it’s used with a datatype outside of its usual domain.</p>

<p>Note that the term is <em>overloading</em>, not <em>overriding</em>, and there’s an
important difference between the two. Overriding would mean you’re
changing the existing meaning of an operator; TADS <strong>doesn’t</strong> let you
do this. For example, you can’t change the meaning of “+” as it applies
to integer values, because the TADS virtual machine has a built-in
definition for that operator on that combination of types. Overloading,
in contrast, is the extension of an operator to a new type that it
normally doesn’t work with, so it’s not superseding anything that’s
already built into the system.</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with operator overloading from other programming
languages, and you want an overview of what it’s good for, you can skip
ahead to the section on <a href="#uses">uses</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-operators-are-applied">How operators are applied</h2>

<p>Before we talk about how to overload an operator, we have to know
<em>where</em> to put the overload. To determine that, it’s important to
understand how TADS applies operators to values.</p>

<p>TADS is a dynamically typed language: the datatype of a variable or
expression isn’t declared in the source code, but is determined based on
the actual values being used at the moment the expression is executed.
As such, the exact meaning of an operator can’t be known until operator
is carried out on live data. Many operators have meanings that vary
according to the types of the values they’re applied to. For example,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> can mean integer addition, string
concatenation, or list appending.</p>

<p>Each time an operator is executed, its meaning is determined by looking
at a specific one of its operands. (An operand is a value that an
operator is applied to. In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3 + 4</code>, the operator
is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> and the operands are
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4</code>.) The choice
of which operand controls the meaning is fixed for each operator: it’s
always the same, no matter what types are involved.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>unary</strong> operator is one that applies to a single operand value,
such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-3</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~x</code>.
A unary operator’s meaning is determined by the type of its single
operand.</li>
  <li>A <strong>binary</strong> operator is one that applies to two values, such as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 + 7</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lst\[i\]</code>.
All of the overloadable binary operators use the <strong>left</strong> operand as
the controlling operand. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'hello' +
7</code> is interpreted as a string concatenation, because the left
operand is a string.</li>
  <li>A <strong>ternary</strong> operator applies to three values. The only overloadable
ternary operator is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x\[y\] = z</code>, and the type
of this operator is determined by the leftmost operand
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, each time an operator is evaluated, TADS first fully evaluates each
operand to get the actual, live value of that sub-expression. It then
looks at the datatype of the value for the controlling operand.</p>

<p>If this is one of the primitive types, such as integer or nil, TADS
simply carries out its built-in definition of the operator for that
type. There’s no way to change this through operator overloading;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3 + 4</code> will always yield 7.</p>

<p>If the controlling operand is an object value, and it’s an object of one
of the intrinsic class types (String, List, LookupTable, etc.), the
machine checks to see if that class defines a meaning for the operator.
For example, String defines <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> as
concatenation, and List defines <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[\]</code> as
indexing the list. If there’s a built-in meaning for the operator, TADS
carries out that meaning. As with the primitive types, there’s no way to
change this through operator overloading.</p>

<p>If the controlling operand is an object value, and the object doesn’t
have a built-in meaning for the operator, <em>this</em> is where operator
overloading kicks in. TADS checks to see if the object defines or
inherits an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator</code> method for this specific
operator. If so, TADS invokes the method, and uses the return value of
the method as the operator result.</p>

<p>If there’s no built-in definition for the operator, and there’s no
corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator</code> method defined by the
controlling operand value, TADS gives up and throws a run-time error to
signal that the operator isn’t valid for that combination of types.</p>

<h2 id="defining-an-overloaded-operator">Defining an overloaded operator</h2>

<p>An overloaded operator is a special kind of method. You define it
alongside ordinary properties and methods when you define a class or
object. An overload method uses a special name that starts with the
keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator</code>, followed by the operator to
be overloaded, followed by an ordinary argument list and method body.</p>

<p>For example, to overload the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> operator for a
class, you’d define a method called “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator
+</code>”:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class ScopeList: object
       operator +(x)
       {
         local l = new ScopeList();
         l.scope = scope;
         l.scope += x;
         return l;
       }

       scope = []
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator</code> method is always invoked on the
controlling operand of the operator. This is the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> value for the method. The remaining
operands are passed as arguments to the method. This means that the
number of arguments is always one less than the number of operands.</p>

<p>That’s why the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator +</code> we defined in the
example above only takes one argument. Since the controlling operand of
a binary operator is the left operand, the expression
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a + b</code> effectively becomes a call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a.operator +(b)</code>. (That’s not real syntax,
though: you can’t use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator+</code> to make a call
to the method. To call the method you have to use the algebraic syntax,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a + b</code>.)</p>

<p>Apart from the special naming syntax, an operator overload method is
written just like an ordinary method. It’s fine to trigger side effects
(such as displaying text on the screen), call other methods and
functions as normal, and call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delegated</code> as usual. Note, though, that the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator</code> syntax can’t be used as a method name
in a regular method call or in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delegated</code>, so you can’t straightforwardly have
class Sub’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator +</code> method inherit, say,
class Base’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator \*</code> method.</p>

<p>The method should return a value to be used as the result of the
operator expression. If there’s no explicit
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> statement, the compiler will supply
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> as the default return value, as it does
for any other method.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a\[b\]</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[\]=</code></p>

<p>ternary</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a\[b\] = c</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator \[\]=(b, c)</code></p>

<p>You can only overload the operators listed above. Notably, you can’t
overload any of the comparison operators (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!=</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;=</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;=</code>), the logical operators
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;&amp;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\|\|</code>), the
“if-nil” operator (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">??</code>), or the conditional
operator (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">? :</code>). You also can’t overload the
regular assignment operator (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>), but you <em>can</em>
override the index-and-assign operator, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[\]=</code>.</p>

<p>The compound assignment operators, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+=</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-=</code>, also can’t be separately overloaded.
However, when these operators are executed, the system actually handles
them as though they were written out as separate steps, so the
non-assignment part will still invoke your overload. For example, the
code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a += b</code> will invoke
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a.operator +(b)</code> to compute the value to assign
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>. The same applies to the increment and
decrement operators, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">++</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--</code>. The compiler decomposes
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a++</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a = a+1</code>, so
while you can’t overload <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">++</code> separately, you
can still intervene in such an expression by overloading
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code>.</p>

<p>You’ve probably noticed the odd man out in the table, “operator negate”.
This is unary negation operator, which in actual expressions is just a
minus sign “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code>”. Now, the minus sign is also
used as the two-operand subtraction operator. The language gets away
with reusing the same symbol for “negative a” and “a minus b” in
expressions because it’s always clear from context which is which. But
with operator overloading, there’s no such context in one important
situation, which is getting a property pointer: does
“<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;operator-</code>” mean “operator minus” or
“operator negate”? TADS solves this problem by defining
“<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator -</code>” solely as the subtraction
operator, and renaming the negation operator to
“<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator negate</code>”.</p>

<p>The indexing operator’s method syntax might also look odd, because you’d
normally write the argument to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[\]</code> inside the
brackets. But the correct syntax is as shown in the table, with the
argument in parentheses after the brackets. This makes the method syntax
consistent for all of the different operators.</p>

<p>The index-and-assign operator is worth mentioning because it might not
be obvious what the return value from this method would mean. The
primary function of the operator is to assign a value to the indexed
element. So should it simply return the assigned value? No: it should
actually return the <em>container</em> value. In many cases, this is simply
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>, but not always. Some types create a new
object when any change is made to their contents. That’s how List works,
for example. When you assign to a list element, a new list is created to
reflect the update, leaving the original list object unchanged. This is
required because a list is immutable . For this case, the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[\]=</code> operator method returns the newly
created container object (the new List object in the List example). If
your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator \[\]=</code> method modifies the
object’s own contents directly, way Vector and LookupTable do, you
should simply return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>, since the “new”
container reflecting the changes is simply the original container,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>.</p>

<h2 id="property-pointers-to-overload-methods">Property pointers to overload methods</h2>

<p>You can’t call an operator overload method by name (you can call it only
through the actual operator syntax), but you <em>can</em> get a pointer an
overload property. Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> operator as
normal, and simply use the same name as the method definition uses. For
example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    if (obj.propDefined(&amp;operator -))
       "- is defined for 'obj'\n";
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="list-like-objects"><span id="listlike">List-like objects</span></h2>

<p>One of the consequences of being able to overload operators is that you
can create custom objects that mimic the built-in List type. Not only
can you use these as though they were lists in your own code, but you
can also pass them to most system functions and methods that require
List arguments.</p>

<p>For the purposes of <strong>system</strong> functions and methods, a list-like object
is defined as an object that provides the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator \[\]</code> overload method</li>
  <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">length()</code> method taking zero arguments</li>
</ul>

<p>Most intrinsic functions and methods will interpret an object providing
these methods as list-like. The “…” argument expansion operator also
recognizes this interface.</p>

<p>An object that meets this definition <strong>must</strong> return an integer value
from its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">length()</code> method. The system will
invoke it expecting to get an element count as the result, so a
non-integer return value will trigger a type conversion error.</p>

<p>Note that if you plan to use a custom object as though it were a list in
your own functions and methods, you might also want to include the
Collection method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createIterator()</code>. This
method is required for an object to be used with the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foreach</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for..in</code>
statements. This isn’t required for system functions that take List
arguments, because those callers only expect the basic List-style
interface. But by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createIterator()</code>, you
can ensure that your object behaves like a generic Collection for places
where you own code might use it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foreach</code>
or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for..in</code>.</p>

<p>You might also want to define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator \[\]=</code>,
since if you’re passing it to code written to expect true List values,
the code might assign element values.</p>

<h2 id="intrinsic-classes">Intrinsic classes</h2>

<p>It’s legal to add overloaded operators for intrinsic classes. The syntax
is the same as for a regular operator overload method, and goes in a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modify</code> definition for the intrinsic class, the
same as for any other intrinsic class extensions.</p>

<p>You can <em>add</em> an operator to an intrinsic class, but you can’t override
an operator that’s already defined. In other words, you can only add
operators that the intrinsic class doesn’t define internally. For
example, you can’t override <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator +</code> for
String, because String defines <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> as the
concatenation operator.</p>

<p>If you attempt to override an operator on an intrinsic class that’s
already defined by the built-in class, the compiler will accept the
definition without a complaint, but the method will never be called at
run-time. The virtual machine always looks first for a native definition
for an operator, and only looks for an overloaded operator method if the
native method doesn’t exist. This is the same way that all intrinsic
class methods work, actually: you can’t override String.length() either,
because a native version is given priority over an extension in a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modify</code> definition.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>You can only overload the operators specifically listed earlier. Other
operators aren’t eligible for overloading.</p>

<p>You can’t change the syntax or precedence of an operator. For example,
you can’t redefine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;</code> as a unary operator,
or change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[\]</code> from a postfix to a prefix, or
give <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> higher precedence than
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\*</code>.</p>

<p>There’s no way to create new operators.</p>

<p>It’s not possible to override an operator that’s defined for a system
type. For example, you can’t redefine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[\]</code> for
a List, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> for a String.</p>

<p>There’s no way to override operators on primitive (non-object) types,
such as integers.</p>

<p>propDefined(), propType(), getPropList(), and getPropParams() don’t work
for the built-in operators of intrinsic classes, such as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator +</code> for a String or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator \[\]</code> for a List. They’ll simply act
as though you’re talking about an undefined method. For example,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'x'.propDefined(&amp;operator +)</code> will return nil,
even though <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> certainly does work with
strings. The VM-defined operators of intrinsic classes are essentially
built in, so there’s no equivalent of an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">operator</code> method represented in the type
system. For the same reason, you can’t inherit from or delegate to a
built-in operator of an intrinsic class.</p>

<h2 id="typical-uses"><span id="uses">Typical uses</span></h2>

<p>Operator overloading has been a feature of mainstream programming
languages since the 1960s; modern examples include C++ and Python. Over
the years, some common patterns of usage have emerged, as well as some
pitfalls.</p>

<p>The original use case, which motivated the first implementations, was
custom numeric types. The canonical example is complex numbers, but
there are also vectors (in the mathematical sense), tensors, etc. An
extended numeric type is a natural fit for the algebraic operators,
since that’s exactly the notation that mathematicians have always used
for them. The ability to define the standard operators on new numeric
types lets you create types that can be used almost as though they were
native. Using algebraic operators can make it easier to write code using
the types than if you had to use function calls, and can make the code
not only more concise to write, but easier to understand when read.</p>

<p>The second common use is for creating types that aren’t numerical in
nature, but where some of the algebraic operators still have intuitive
meanings. The String and List classes are built-in examples: in both
cases, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> operator has a fairly intuitive
meaning, even though it doesn’t involve arithmetic addition. As with
numeric types, operator definitions can make custom object types easier
to use and make code at once more concise and clearer.</p>

<p>The second-and-a-half use is for creating your own custom objects that
mimic built-in objects that use operators. For example, you could create
a special “Scope List” class that represents the set of objects in
scope, but which can be used as though it were an ordinary list by code
that doesn’t need to access its special features. You could do this by
defining the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[\]</code> (indexing) operators on the object to act
the same way they do with a regular List object.</p>

<p>The third use is simply to make code more concise, by using operators
for frequently called methods instead of spelling out method names. This
is only subtly different from the second case; the distinction we’re
drawing is that you can define an operator on an object even when there
<em>isn’t</em> an obvious, intuitive meaning that’s somehow analogous to the
usual arithmetic meaning of the operator. In these cases you don’t
define operators for their clarity, but only for their concision. For
example, the C++ standard libraries redefine
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;\&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;</code> on
file stream objects as “read” and “write” operators. This has nothing to
do with the ordinary arithmetic meaning of the operators, so in that
sense it’s a completely arbitrary reassignment of the operators, but it
at least has a sort of visual logic to it.</p>

<p>This third use of overloading is somewhat controversial. Among C++
developers, it’s taken for granted and largely accepted, because the
language’s inventor embedded the idea in the standard C++ libraries from
the beginning. However, the criticism is that it hurts code clarity by
arbitrarily redefining what an operator does, to such an extent that a
reader would never guess the meaning of the code just by looking at it.
Most people would intuitively know what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> does
when applied to a String or List, but unless you’ve read the C++ I/O
documentation, you’d probably never guess that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;</code> can sometimes write to the console. (In
fact, the TADS VM source code itself, which is written in C++, is
largely free of overloaded operators out of just these concerns.) If
you’re writing an extension or library that other people will use, it’s
probably best to use this sort of overloading sparingly.</p>
