<h1 id="network-safety-in-tads">Network Safety in TADS</h1>

<p>Starting with version 3.1, TADS offers several networking features in
the interpreter. Networking creates a certain amount of risk, since the
whole point is to enable data transfer between distant machines whose
owners don’t know each other personally.</p>

<p>Some people are justifiably nervous about running applications with any
sort of networking features. TADS therefore gives the user control over
how much, if any, network access is available to the game program. This
section explains how these “network safety” features work. We also offer
some analysis of why we think the TADS networking features are
relatively safe by design, to help you decide on appropriate safety
level settings.</p>

<h2 id="safety-level-settings">Safety level settings</h2>

<p>You can limit the networking features that a game program can access
using the “network safety level” setting. This is an interpreter feature
under the end user’s control; games can’t override it.</p>

<p>There are actually two separate network safety level settings. The
<em>client</em> level controls the game program’s ability to initiate
connections to other machines. For example, this applies when the game
tries to establish an HTTP connection to a Web server to download a
page. The <em>server</em> level controls the game’s ability to set up services
of its own that can accept connections from other machines.</p>

<p>For each role (client or server), there are three levels of access you
can grant. The levels are given as numbers, with higher numbers meaning
higher “safety” - i.e., more restricted access.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 0: All network access. This is the minimum safety level; it
allows unrestricted access to the network for both local and remote
Internet connections.</li>
  <li>Level 1: Local access only. This only allows access to or from other
programs on the <em>same computer</em>. No other machines on the network will
be accessible.</li>
  <li>Level 2: No network access. This is the highest safety level; it
completely disables the network functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The network safety level settings are controlled via interpreter
options. The user interface varies by interpreter. In HTML TADS for
Windows, the Options dialog controls these settings. For command-line
interpreters, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ns</code> option controls the
safety level. See the <a href="terp.html#network-safety">interpreter
documentation</a> for details.</p>

<p>The default safety settings are Level 1, local access only, for both
client and server functions.</p>

<h2 id="just-how-risky-is-it">Just how risky is it?</h2>

<p>We obviously can’t make blanket assurances that the TADS networking
features are completely free of risk. All past experience with networked
systems shows that there are always security holes and exploitable bugs.
Even so, we think that the TADS network setup is relatively secure.</p>

<p>When you hear “Web server”, you might think of the million-and-one
exploitable holes in the popular Web scripting languages. You might also
think of the difficulty of configuring a server like Apache, and the
danger of exposing the machine to hackers if you configure it wrong.</p>

<p>Fortunately, The TADS Web server simply isn’t comparable to those
systems. Most of their common security risks don’t apply to the TADS
networking system.</p>

<p>First, for a general-purpose server like Apache, its whole purpose in
life is to serve up files from your hard disk. Half of the configuration
is basically to tell it what <em>not</em> to do. TADS takes the opposite
approach: the TADS Web server doesn’t answer <em>any</em> requests on its own.
The only thing it does automatically is parse the protocol and forward
requests to the game program. Everything else is up to the game program.</p>

<p>Second, even before the networking features came along, TADS <em>already</em>
had a number of security features that made it safer to run third-party
software on your system. TADS is a “sandboxed” system: games can’t run
native machine code, so they can only do what the interpreter
specifically enables them to do. This means that they can’t invoke the
operating system directly; they can only access the OS through built-in
functions and classes, which intentionally restrict which OS resources a
game can access (the “file safety” settings, for example, let the user
control file system access).</p>

<p>As we explained above, the TADS Web server doesn’t do anything on its
own: it’s up to the game itself to handle requests. That means a TADS
Web server can only do what a TADS game can do, therefore a TADS Web
server is subject to the same sandboxing features as a regular TADS
game.</p>

<p>Third, many of the common “gotchas” in server programming systems like
php come from language features that aren’t relevant in TADS. For
example, the common php “variable injection” attack isn’t possible in
TADS: request parameters are cleanly isolated in an object structure,
and can’t “leak” into the language to impersonate variables. The php
“remote include” attack isn’t possible in TADS for similar reasons.</p>

<h2 id="firewalls-proxies-security-suites">Firewalls, proxies, security suites</h2>

<p>If your computer is on a home network, you probably have some sort of
hardware security device on the network, such as a broadband router with
a firewall. If you’re on a business network, you probably have a more
elaborate dedicated firewall or VPN router. These devices are designed
to isolate the local (home or business) network from the public
Internet, to prevent hackers from outside your local network from
accessing computers within your network. In addition, many people run
firewall software directly on their computers to block any attacks that
make it past the hardware routers and firewalls, as well as attacks that
originate from other PCs within the local network.</p>

<p>The TADS network safety level controls are completely independent of any
of these security devices or software you’re using. The TADS safety
level restrictions are purely additive to any external security
measures. TADS can’t and won’t bypass, override, or reconfigure any of
your other firewalls: even if you set the safety level to 0 in TADS, it
doesn’t remove any of the other restrictions or firewalls you have in
place.</p>

<p>This is particularly important to understand if you want to run a TADS
program that accepts connections across the Internet. Setting server
safety level 0 in TADS allows the game program to create a server that
can accept connections from any other machine. However, for a remote
machine to connect to the game, it first has to be able to connect to
your machine. Firewalls are usually set up to prevent this, by blocking
incoming connections from the Internet entirely. In order to set up a
game server at home, you’ll probably have to specially configure your
broadband router or firewall to allow incoming connections to your
machine. This is beyond the scope of this chapter, so we’ll have to
refer you to the instruction manuals for your network boxes and/or your
PC’s firewall software.</p>
