<h1 id="basic-tokenizer">Basic Tokenizer</h1>

<p>“Tokenizing” is the process of scanning a string of characters, such as
a line of text that the user types at a command prompt, and converting
the character string into a list of words and punctuation marks. Each
item in this list is called a “token.” During parsing, we wish to deal
with tokens, not directly with the original character string; it’s much
easier and faster to work with tokens. To parse a string, we must find
word boundaries, skip whitespace, and find matching delimiters (such as
quotes and parentheses); we do all of this work in advance, when we
tokenize the string, so that we don’t have to do it repeatedly while
analyzing the syntax of the command.</p>

<p>TADS 3 has no built-in tokenizer. Instead, the system library provides a
class called Tokenizer that does this job. You can create a custom
tokenizer, if desired, by subclassing Tokenizer. The adv3 library does
this to provide a more elaborate set of lexical rules for the English
parser.</p>

<h2 id="calling-the-tokenizer">Calling the Tokenizer</h2>

<p>To use the Tokenizer class, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\#include
\&lt;tok.h\&gt;</code> in your source code. (You’ll also have to include the
library module tok.t in your build, but you’re probably already doing
this indirectly by including the standard system library file,
system.tl, in your build.)</p>

<p>To use the default rules defined in the class, simply use the class
directly; to tokenize a string, make a call like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local str, tokList;

    str = inputLine();
    tokList = Tokenizer.tokenize(str);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokenize()</code> method scans the string and
converts it into a list of tokens. The return value is a list consisting
of one element per token. Information about each token can be obtained
using the following macros:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getTokVal(*tok*)</code> returns the parsed value of
the token. This is usually a string corresponding to the text matched
by the regular expression, but can be another type if the token rule
generated it with some other value type.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getTokType(*tok*)</code> returns the type of the
token. This is a token type enumerator value assigned by the rule that
matched the token. The default Tokenizer rules produce tokens of type
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokPunct</code> (punctuation marks),
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokWord</code> (words),
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokString</code> (strings), and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokInt</code> (integer numbers).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getTokOrig(*tok*)</code> returns the original
source text the token matched. This information is included because
some token rules perform conversions on the value; for example,
dictionary word tokens usually have their values converted to all
upper-case or all lower-case for convenience in string comparisons.
The original text is included so that the exact original token input
can be easily reconstructed if needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following code displays the parsed value of each token in a string:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    for (local i = 1, local cnt = tokList.length() ; i &lt;= cnt ; ++i)
      "[&lt;&lt;i&gt;&gt;] = &lt;&lt;getTokVal(tokList[i])&gt;&gt;\n";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(For the curious, the actual representation of a token is a list
containing three elements: element 1 is the token value, element 2 is
the token type, and element 3 is the original matched text. For more
readable code and greater flexibility in case of future changes to this
format, you should always use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getTokXxx()</code>
macros rather than referring to the list elements directly.)</p>

<h2 id="customizing-the-tokenizer">Customizing the Tokenizer</h2>

<p>You can customize the rules the Tokenizer class uses. To do this,
subclass Tokenizer and override the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rules\_</code>
property. This property’s value must be a list of lists. Each sublist
consists of five elements: a string giving the name of the rule; a
regular expression specifying a pattern to match; a token type, which is
the enum token value to assign to tokens matching the regular
expression; a conversion rule, specifying how the token text to be
stored in the result list is obtained; and a match method property
pointer, which allows a programmatic check to determine whether or not
the token matches the rule.</p>

<p>The name is for your use in identifying the rule. You can give a rule
whatever name you like. The tokenizer class has methods that manipulate
the rule set at run-time; rule names are used to identify which rules to
operate on with these methods.</p>

<p>The conversion rule can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, a string, or a
property pointer. If the conversion rule is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, then the token text stored in the result
list will simply be the exact text of the input string that matches the
regular expression. If the rule is a string, it specifies a replacement
string, using the same rules as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rexReplace()</code>,
that’s applied to the matching text; the result of the replacement is
stored in the result list. If the conversion rule is a property pointer,
it specifies a property (of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>, which is the
Tokenizer object which is doing the work) to be evaluated to yield the
value to be stored in the result list; this property is called as
follows:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self.(*prop*)(*txt*, *typ*, *results*)</code></p>

<p>In this argument list, <em>txt</em> is a string giving the text that was
matched for the token; <em>typ</em> is the token type enum value from the rule
list; and <em>results</em> is a Vector containing the token output list under
construction. This method simply adds any number of token entries to the
results list by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">results.append()</code>. The
method need not add any tokens; the default tokenizer rule for
whitespace, for example, uses a processor method called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokCvtSkip()</code>, which doesn’t do anything at
all, which means that whitespace characters in the input result in no
tokens in the results list.</p>

<p>The match method can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or a property
pointer. If it’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, the regular expression
solely determines what text matches the rule. If the match method is a
property pointer, though, the tokenizer calls the property (on
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>, the Tokenizer object which is doing the
work) as follows:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self.(*prop*)(*txt*)</code></p>

<p>This method can examine the text to determine if it’s really a match for
the rule; the method returns true if the text matches the rule, nil if
not. The match method can be used for more complex checks that cannot be
performed with the regular expression pattern; for example, a match
method can check to see if the token is a known dictionary word, so that
a rule only matches known dictionary words.</p>

<h2 id="rule-processing-order">Rule Processing Order</h2>

<p>The rules are specified in order of priority. The tokenizer starts with
the first rule; if the first rule’s regular expression matches (and the
rule’s match method, if present, returns
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>), the tokenizer uses the match and
ignores all of the remaining rules. If the first rule’s regular
expression does not match (or its match method returns
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>), the tokenizer tries the second rule, and
so on until it runs out of rules.</p>

<p>Each time the tokenizer finds a matching rule, it adds the result of
applying the conversion rule to the result list, along with the token
type specified by the rule. The tokenizer then removes the matching text
from the input string. If that leaves the input string empty, the
tokenizer returns the result list to the caller. If the input string is
not yet empty, the tokenizer starts over, searching from the first rule
to find a match to the remainder of the string. The tokenizer repeats
this process until the input string is empty.</p>

<p>If the tokenizer exhausts its list of rules, it throws a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TokErrorNoMatch</code> exception. This exception
object has a property, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remainingStr\_</code>, which
gives the text of the remainder of the string at the point at which the
tokenizer could find no matching rule.</p>

<h2 id="customization-example">Customization Example</h2>

<p>Suppose we wished to build a simple four-function calculator, which
reads arithmetic expressions typed by the user and displays the results.
For this calculator, we’d need to recognize two types of tokens:
operators, and numbers. There’s already a tokInt type defined by the
Tokenizer class, but we’d have to define our own token type for
operators:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    enum token tokOp;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default tokenizer rules won’t work for the calculator because they
don’t accept all of the punctuation marks we’d need to use for operators
(and besides, the default rules classify the punctuation marks they do
recognize as type tokPunct, when we want tokOp tokens).</p>

<p>We’ll need the following token rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whitespace, which we want to ignore so that the user can use spaces
freely to format expressions.</li>
  <li>Integers, which consist of a series of one or more digits.</li>
  <li>Operators, which are the special punctuation marks that indicate
arithmetic operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s how our subclass would look to implement these rules:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    CalcTokenizer: Tokenizer
      rules_ =
      [
        /* skip whitespace */
        ['whitespace', R'[ \t]+', nil, &amp;tokCvtSkip, nil],

        /* integer numbers */
        ['integer', R'[0-9]+', tokInt, nil, nil],

        /* operators */
        ['operator', R'[()+*-/]', tokOp, nil, nil]
      ]
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To tokenize using our customized rules, we’d simply call our subclasses
tokenizer rather than the default tokenizer:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    tokList = CalcTokenizer.tokenize(str);
</code></pre></div></div>
