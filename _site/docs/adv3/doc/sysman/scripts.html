<h1 id="input-scripts">Input Scripts</h1>

<p>The TADS Interpreter normally reads its input directly from the
computer’s human input devices - primarily the keyboard, but sometimes
also the mouse, if one is present and the local Interpreter supports it.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, it’s useful to be able to read from a previously
prepared list of inputs rather than from the user. One situation where
this is helpful is during development: you can use a script to enter all
of the commands needed to reach the part of the game you’re actively
working on, saving you the trouble of re-entering those commands
manually every time you start a new test run after making changes.
Another situation is testing: you can use a script to run through the
game to make sure that it produces the correct output.</p>

<p>The Interpreter provides “script” files for this purpose. A script file
is simply a text file with a list of command inputs. When you tell the
Interpreter to read from a script file, it reads the commands from the
file, and returns them to the game as though they were coming directly
from the keyboard. The game doesn’t know the difference; as far as the
game is concerned, the user is typing the commands.</p>

<h2 id="replaying-a-script">Replaying a script</h2>

<p>There are two way to replay a script: via the interpreter command line,
or through a call to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile()</code>
function.</p>

<h3 id="replaying-via-the-interpreter-command-line">Replaying via the interpreter command line</h3>

<p>You can start reading a script immediately when you start the game by
using the Interpreter’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-i</code> option. Refer to
<a href="terp.html">Running Programs</a> for information on this option.</p>

<p>The Interpreter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-i</code> option causes the game to
read from the script starting with the very first command line. On
operating systems with “batch” or “command script” features, this lets
you create automated processes, such as test suites, that run without
any user intervention.</p>

<h3 id="replaying-via-setscriptfile">Replaying via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile()</code></h3>

<p>The intrinsic function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile()</code> lets
you start reading from a script under program control. Refer to <a href="tadsio.html">the
tads-io Function Set</a> for details on this function.</p>

<p>The adv3 library uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile()</code> to
implement the REPLAY command, which you can use to invoke a script from
the game’s command prompt.</p>

<h2 id="recording-a-script">Recording a script</h2>

<p>The Interpreter has a couple of features that let you record a session
as you play through a game manually. The interpreter creates a file
containing the commands and events you enter as you play.</p>

<p>To create a script from an entire session, use the Interpreter’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-o</code> option. This causes the Interpreter to
write events throughout the session to the file. See <a href="terp.html">Running
Programs</a> for details on Interpreter options.</p>

<p>If your game is based on the adv3 library, you can use the RECORD
command to record a script. This command starts recording events
starting with the next command line.</p>

<p>You can also start recording a script under program control, using the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setLogFile()</code> function with the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogTypeCommand</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogTypeEvent</code> type codes.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogTypeCommand</code> creates a Command-line script,
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogTypeEvent</code> creates an Event script (see
below). The adv3 RECORD command uses this function internally.</p>

<h2 id="script-file-structure">Script file structure</h2>

<p>This section explains how to create a script file manually. In most
cases, you’ll probably want to create your script files using one of the
“recording” features (such as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-o</code>
Interpreter option, or the adv3 RECORD command), but you might sometimes
want to create a script file on your own, or edit a script you recorded.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of script files: Command-line scripts and Event
scripts. Interpreters prior to 3.0.13 only support Command-line scripts;
3.0.13 and later versions support both kinds of script.</p>

<h3 id="command-line-scripts">Command-line scripts</h3>

<p>A command-line script contains regular input lines. This means that when
the Interpreter is reading from a command-line script, it must still
pause for user input, directly from the keyboard or mouse, whenever the
game attempts to read any other kind of input event -
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputDialog()</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputFile()</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>Each line of a command-line script is either a comment or an input line.</p>

<p>An input line starts with a &gt; character (a greater-than sign) as its
very first character; the rest of the line is the text of the input. The
interpreter reads the line and returns it to the game as though the user
had typed it at the keyboard and pressed Enter.</p>

<p>Any line that doesn’t start with &gt; is a comment line. The interpreter
simply ignores these lines.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample Command-line script.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    This is a comment, since it doesn't start with "&gt;"

    &gt;look
    &gt;inventory
    &gt;quit
    &gt;yes
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="event-script">Event script</h3>

<p>Unlike a Command-line script, an Event script can contain any type of
input event that the game can read. This means that an Event script can
run without any user input.</p>

<p>Event scripts are supported only in version 3.0.13 and later of the
Interpreter.</p>

<p>An event script is identified with this text as its very first line:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    &lt;eventscript&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When the Interpreter starts reading a script, it checks the first line
to see if it contains this text. If so, it treats it as an Event script;
if not, it treats the script as a regular Command-line script.</p>

<p>After the initial <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;eventscript\&gt;</code> line, the
rest of the file contains event lines and comment lines. An event line
starts with an event type tag; everything else is a comment line. The
Interpreter ignores comment lines.</p>

<p>An “event tag” is one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;line\&gt;</code> - a command line input event. The
rest of the line is the text of the line input. This type of event is
returned by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLine()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code>; all other input
functions ignore (and skip) these events.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;endqs\&gt;</code> - a quiet script ending event.
This type of event is returned by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLine()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code>; other input functions
ignore (and skip) these events.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;key\&gt;</code> - a keyboard key event. The rest of
the line is the key name. The key names are exactly as returned from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputKey()</code>, <strong>except</strong> that the keys that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputKey()</code> returns as ASCII control codes
are represented as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[ctrl-x\]</code> characters:
‘\n’ (newline) represented as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[enter\]</code>,
‘\t’ (tab) is represented as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[tab\]</code>, and ‘
‘(space) as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[space\]</code>. This type of event is
returned by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputKey()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code>; all other input functions
ignore (and skip) these events.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;dialog\&gt;</code> - a dialog button event. The rest
of the line is a number giving the index of the button pressed in a
dialog. This is returned by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputDialog()</code>;
other input functions ignore (and skip) these events.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;file\&gt;</code> - a file dialog event. The rest of
the line is the name of the file selected, or is empty is the dialog
was canceled. This is returned by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputFile()</code>; other input functions ignore
(and skip) these events.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;href\&gt;</code> - a hyperlink click event. The rest
of the line is the HREF value for the hyperlink. This is returned by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code> only; all other input functions
ignore (and skip) these events.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;timeout\&gt;</code> - a timeout event. This
indicates that a call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> terminated with a
timeout. The rest of the line is the text of the partial input line
that was entered before the timeout occurred; this is used only in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code>. This type of event is
returned by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code>; all other input function
ignore (and skip) these events.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;notimeout\&gt;</code> - a timeout-not-available
error event. This can be returned from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code>; other functions ignore (and
skip) these events.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;eof\&gt;</code> - an end-of-file error event. This
can be returned from most of the input functions. Note that this is
<em>not</em> an indication that the script file has ended, so this isn’t
necessary as the last entry in a script; rather, this indicates that
an end-of-file error occurred reading from the actual user interface
when the script was recorded. An end-of-file error usually means that
the user closed the Interpreter window before quitting the game, or
disconnected or closed a terminal session.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a sample Event script.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    &lt;eventscript&gt;
    &lt;line&gt;look
    &lt;line&gt;inventory
    &lt;line&gt;save
    &lt;file&gt;test.t3v
    &lt;line&gt;help
    &lt;key&gt;[down]
    &lt;key&gt;[enter]
    &lt;key&gt;[esc]
    &lt;line&gt;quit
    &lt;line&gt;y
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="overwrite-warnings-in-file-events">Overwrite warnings in &lt;file&gt; events</h2>

<p>When inputFile() reads a &lt;file&gt; event from a script, the function
checks the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the file named in the event already exists</li>
  <li>the <em>dialogType</em> parameter to inputFile() is InFileSave</li>
  <li>the &lt;file&gt; element does not include the “overwrite” attribute</li>
</ul>

<p>If all of these conditions are true, then inputFile() momentarily
suspends the script playback and displays a warning dialog to the user.
This dialog is displayed interactively, even though a script is being
played back, and the user must respond before script playback can
continue.</p>

<p>The dialog warns that the script might be about to overwrite the named
file, and asks if you’d like to proceed. You have three options: Yes,
No, or Cancel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you select Yes, the script playback will continue as-is, and the
filename read from the script will be returned to the game, which
might then overwrite the file.</li>
  <li>If you select No, the Interpreter will display an interactive file
selector dialog, allowing you to select a different filename. If you
enter another filename, script playback will continue, using the new
filename you entered in place of the one read from the script. If you
cancel the file dialog, script playback will be canceled immediately,
with no further events played back, and the game will return to
interactive play. The inputFile() function will return a Cancel result
code to the game.</li>
  <li>If you select Cancel, script playback will be canceled immediately,
with no further events played back, and the game will return to
interactive play. The inputFile() function will return a Cancel result
code to the game.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for this extra interactive prompt is to prevent script
playback from overwriting a file without the user’s knowledge or
consent. The whole point of script playback is to reproduce the same
sequence of events repeatedly, but this can be problematic when one of
the events supplies a filename that’s then used to create a new file: if
the script is run more than once, the file will be created anew on each
subsequent run, overwriting any data written to the file on previous
runs.</p>

<p>In some cases, you might want to skip the interactive prompt, but still
overwrite any existing copy of the file. This is especially likely if
you’re using a script for automated testing. In such a case, you
probably specifically designed the test to create the same output file
on each run, so you specifically intend for the test to overwrite the
file each time; and you want the test to run automatically, with no user
intervention. In such a case, you can put instructions directly in the
script that the overwrite is to proceed without a prompt. To do this,
edit the script file, and add the “overwrite” attribute to the &lt;file&gt;
element:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    &lt;file overwrite&gt;myfile.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This tells the script reader that you explicitly intend to overwrite the
file on each run, so no interactive prompt is necessary. Note that
adding the “overwrite” attribute doesn’t <em>require</em> the file to exist -
it merely suppresses the warning if it does.</p>
