<p>When the VM encounters an error in the user program, it throws an
exception of class RuntimeError. This exception object always contains
an integer value its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">errno\_</code> property giving
the VM error code for the error condition. Programs that need to apply
special handling for certain types of errors can determine the specific
VM error condition via the error code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">errno\_</code>.</p>

argument</span></p>

<p>An invalid datatype was provided for an intrinsic function argument.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2305: default output function is not defined</span></p>

<p>The default output function is not defined. Implicit string display is
not allowed until a default output function is specified.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2306: invalid value for intrinsic function
argument</span></p>

<p>An invalid value was specified for an intrinsic function argument. The
value is out of range or is not an allowed value.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2307: breakpoint encountered</span></p>

<p>A breakpoint instruction was encountered, and no debugger is active. The
compiler might have inserted this breakpoint to indicate an invalid or
unreachable location in the code, so executing this instruction probably
indicates an error in the program.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2308: external function calls are not implemented in
this version</span></p>

<p>This version of the interpreter does not implement external function
calls. This program requires an interpreter that provides external
function call capabilities, so this program is not compatible with this
interpreter.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2309: invalid opcode modifier - possible image file
corruption</span></p>

<p>Invalid instruction opcode modifier - the image file might be corrupted.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2310: No mapping file available for local character
set “<em>xxx</em>”</span></p>

<p>[Warning: no mapping file is available for the local character set
“<em>xxx</em>”. The system will use a default ASCII character set mapping
instead, so accented characters will be displayed without their
accents.]</p>

<p><span class="errid">2311: Unhandled exception: <em>xxx</em></span></p>

<p>Unhandled exception: <em>xxx</em></p>

<p><span class="errid">2312: VM Error: <em>xxx</em></span></p>

<p>VM Error: <em>xxx</em></p>

<p>(This is used as a generic template for VM run-time exception messages.
The interpreter uses this to display unhandled exceptions that terminate
the program.)</p>

<p><span class="errid">2313: VM Error: code <em>nnn</em></span></p>

<p>VM Error: code <em>nnn</em></p>

<p>(This is used as a generic template for VM run-time exceptions. The
interpreter uses this to report unhandled exceptions that terminate the
program. When it can’t find any message for the VM error code, the
interpreter simply displays the error number using this template.)</p>

<p><span class="errid">2314: Exception in static initializer for
<em>xxx</em>.<em>xxx</em>: <em>xxx</em></span></p>

<p>An exception occurred in the static initializer for <em>xxx</em>.<em>xxx</em>: <em>xxx</em></p>

<p><span class="errid">2315: intrinsic class exception: <em>xxx</em></span></p>

<p>Exception in intrinsic class method: <em>xxx</em></p>

<p><span class="errid">2316: stack access is out of bounds</span></p>

<p>The program attempted to access a stack location that isn’t part of the
current expression storage area. This probably indicates a problem with
the compiler that was used to create this program, or a corrupted
program file.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2391: ‘abort’ signal</span></p>

<p>‘abort’ signal</p>

<p>(This exception is used internally by the debugger to signal program
termination via the debugger UI.)</p>

<p><span class="errid">2392: ‘restart’ signal</span></p>

<p>‘restart’ signal</p>

<p>(This exception is used internally by the debugger to signal program
restart via the debugger UI.)</p>

<p><span class="errid">2394: debugger VM halt</span></p>

<p>debugger VM halt</p>

<p>(This exception is used internally by the debugger to signal program
termination via the debugger UI.)</p>

<p><span class="errid">2395: interrupted by user</span></p>

<p>The program was interrupted by a user interrupt key or other action.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2396: no debugger available</span></p>

<p>An instruction was encountered that requires the debugger, but this
interpreter version doesn’t include debugging capaabilities.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2500: invalid frame in debugger local/parameter
evaluation</span></p>

<p>An invalid stack frame was specified in a debugger local/parameter
evaluation. This probably indicates an internal problem in the debugger.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2501: invalid speculative expression</span></p>

<p>This expression cannot be executed speculatively. (This does not
indicate a problem; it’s merely an internal condition in the debugger.)</p>

<p><span class="errid">2502: invalid debugger expression</span></p>

<p>This expression cannot be evaluated in the debugger.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2503: image file has no debugging information -
recompile for debugging</span></p>

<p>The image file has no debugging information. You must recompile the
source code for this program with debugging information in order to run
the program under the debugger.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2600: out of temporary floating point registers
(calculation too complex)</span></p>

<p>The interpreter is out of temporary floating point registers. This
probably indicates that an excessively complex calculation has been
attempted.</p>

<p><span class="errid">2601: cannot convert value to BigNumber</span></p>

<h2 id="this-value-cannot-be-converted-to-a-bignumber">This value cannot be converted to a BigNumber.</h2>
