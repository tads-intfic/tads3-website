<h1 id="file">File</h1>

<p>The File intrinsic class provides access to create, read, and write
files. Almost all modern operating systems organize disk storage into
files. A file is essentially a block of bytes on disk, labeled with a
name that users and programs can use to refer to it. Most systems also
keep additional “metadata” about each file, such as the date it was
created, the user who created it, and who else has permission to access
it.</p>

<p>In addition to reading and writing ordinary operating system files, the
File class can be used to read TADS “<a href="build.html#resources">resources</a>.”
Resources are most often used for multimedia objects, such as JPEG
images or Ogg audio tracks, but you can also use them as ordinary
external data files. A TADS resource is similar to a file in most
respects, but has three important differences. First, resource names use
a URL-style syntax instead of the local operating system path naming
syntax. This makes it easier to write portable code, since you don’t
have to worry about varying path naming rules when accessing resource
files. Second, you can embed a resource file into the program’s image
(.t3) file, or into an external resource bundle file. The benefit of
embedding resources is that it simplifies packaging by reducing the
number of separate files you have to distribute. Third, resources are
read-only. You can’t change the data in a resource file at run-time.</p>

<p>To use File objects, you must <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\#include
\&lt;file.h\&gt;</code> in your source files.</p>

<h2 id="file-formats">File Formats</h2>

<p>TADS 3 provides access to files using three basic “formats.” A file’s
format is simply the way the file’s data are arranged; each format is
useful in different situations. The basic formats are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Text. A file in text format stores a sequence of ordinary characters
(letters, numbers, punctuation), organized into “lines.” A line of
text is simply a sequence of characters ending with a special
“newline” character or character sequence. Text format files are
useful when you want to read or write data intended for direct viewing
or editing by a person, and because of their simple format can be
interchanged among many different application programs. When you use a
text format file, TADS automatically converts between the Unicode
characters that TADS uses internally and the local character set used
by the file, and TADS also automatically translates newline sequences
in the file according to local conventions, which vary among
platforms.</li>
  <li>Data. A file in “data” format can store integers, enums, strings,
ByteArray values, BigNumber values, and “true” values. Data format
files use a private data format that only TADS can read and write, so
this format is not useful for files that must be interchanged with
other application programs. When you wish to create a file for use
only by your program or other TADS programs, though, this format is
convenient because it allows you to read and write all of the
datatypes listed above directly - TADS automatically converts the
values to and from an appropriate representation in the file. This
format is also convenient because the format is portable to all TADS
platforms - a “data” format file is binary-compatible across all
platforms where TADS runs, with no conversions of any kind necessary
when you copy a file from one type of system to another.</li>
  <li>Raw. A file in raw format simply stores bytes, and gives your program
direct access to the bytes with no automatic translations. This gives
you total flexibility to read and write file formats defined by other
applications or Internet standards, such as JPEG images or word
processing documents. The easiest way to work with a raw file is via
the <a href="pack.html">byte packing</a> methods, <a href="#packBytes">packBytes</a> and
<a href="#unpackBytes">unpackBytes</a>. You can also use the
<a href="readBytes">readBytes</a> and <a href="writeBytes">writeBytes</a> methods to work
directly at the byte level, via <a href="bytearr.html">ByteArray</a> objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Resources can be read using the Text and Raw formats.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-file-object">Creating a File object</h2>

<p>A File object gives you working access to a file on disk. The File
object keeps track of all of the information involved with your access
to the file: the format you’re using to read and write the file, the
type of access you have to the file, and the current position in the
file where you’re reading or writing.</p>

<p>File objects aren’t created with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code>. Instead,
you use one of the “open” methods of the File class itself. The “open”
methods come in two main varities: files and resources. They also
differentiate which type of format you’re using to access the file.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File.openTextFile(*filename*, *access*,
*charset*?)</code><br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File.openDataFile(*filename*, *access*)</code><br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File.openRawFile(*filename*, *access*)</code></p>

<p>The <em>filename</em> argument is one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="filename.html">FileName</a> object naming the file to open.</li>
  <li>A string giving the name of the file to open. This must be a valid
filename in the local file system, conforming to local file <a href="#namingRules">naming
rules</a>.</li>
  <li>A <a href="#specialFile">special file ID</a>.</li>
  <li>A <a href="tempfile.html">TemporaryFile</a> object, specifying a local temporary
file to open. Pass the TemporaryFile object itself, <strong>not</strong> the string
name of the file.</li>
  <li>An object with a <a href="#filespec">File Spec</a> interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>access</em> argument gives the type of access you want to the file, and
determines whether an existing file is to be used or a new file is to be
created. The <em>access</em> value can be one of the following constants:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileAccessRead</code> - the file is to be opened
for reading. The file must exist, or the method will throw a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileNotFoundException</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileAccessWrite</code> - the file is to be opened
for writing. If no file of the given name exists, a new file is
created. If a file with the same name already exists, the existing
file is replaced with the new file, and any contents of the existing
file are discarded. If the file cannot be created, a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileCreationException</code> is thrown.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileAccessReadWriteKeep</code> - the file is to be
opened for both reading and writing. If the file already exists, the
existing file is opened, otherwise a new file is created. If the file
cannot be opened, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileOpenException</code> is
thrown.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileAccessReadWriteTrunc</code> - the file is to be
opened for both reading and writing. If the file already exists, its
existing contents are discarded (the file is truncated to zero
length); if the file doesn’t exist, a new file is created. If the file
cannot be opened, a FileOpenException is thrown.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File.openTextFile(*filename*, *access*,
*charset*?)</code> opens a file in text format. Any access mode may be
used with this method. If the <em>charset</em> argument is present and not
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, it must be an object of the CharacterSet
intrinsic class giving the character set to be used to translate between
the file’s character set and the internal TADS Unicode character set,
<em>or</em> a string giving the name of a character set. If this argument is
missing or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, the system’s default character
set for file contents is used; this is the character set that
<a href="tadsio.html#getLocalCharSet"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getLocalCharSet</code></a><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(CharsetFileCont)</code>
returns.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File.openDataFile(*filename*, *access*)</code> opens
a file in “data” format. Any access mode may be used with this method.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File.openRawFile(*filename*, *access*)</code> opens a
file in “raw” format. Any access mode may be used with this method.</p>

<p>All of the “open” methods check the <a href="terp.html#file-safety">file safety</a>
level settings to ensure that the file access is allowed. If the file
safety level is too restrictive for a requested operation, the method
throws a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileSafetyException</code>. The file safety
level is a setting that the user specifies in a manner that varies by
interpreter; it allows the user to restrict the operations that a
program running under the interpreter can perform, to protect the user’s
computer against malicious programs.</p>

<p>On success, these methods return a new File object that can be used for
subsequent input/output operations on the file. On failure, these
methods will throw a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileException</code> subclass
indicating which type of error occurred:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileNotFoundException</code> - indicates that the
requested file doesn’t exist. This is thrown when the access mode
requires an existing file but the named file does not exist.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileCreationException</code> - indicates that the
requested file could not be created. This is thrown when the access
mode requires creating a new file but the named file cannot be
created.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileOpenException</code> - indicates that the
requested file could not be opened. This is thrown when the access
mode allows either an existing file to be opened or a new file to be
created, but neither could be accomplished.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileSafetyException</code> - the requested access
mode is not allowed for the given file due to the current file safety
level set by the user. Users can set the file safety level (through
command-line switches or other preference mechanisms which vary by
interpreter) to restrict the types of file operations that
applications are allowed to perform, in order to protect their systems
from malicious programs. This exception indicates that the user has
set a safety level that is too restrictive for the requested
operation.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openTextResource(*resName*, *charset*?)</code><br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openRawResource(*resName*)</code></p>

<p>The <em>resName</em> argument gives the name of the resource to be opened. This
is given as a URL-style relative path name: the “/” character is used as
the path separator, but the path cannot start with a “/”, as it must be
relative to the working directory. (This is normally the directory
containing the image file, but some tools override this; for example,
when running inside Workbench for Windows, this is the project
directory. The user can also override it with the <a href="terp.html#-R-option">-R
option</a> when starting the interpreter.) Note that
the URL notation is universal: you must always use the same “/” path
separator notation, regardless of the operating system. The File object
automatically converts the URL-style path to the correct local
conventions. This means that when you’re opening a resource file, you
don’t have to be concerned with the local file system naming rules;
simply use the standard URL format, and the File object will
automatically adapt to the platform at run-time.</p>

<p>The <em>charset</em> argument has the same meaning as it does for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openTextFile()</code>.</p>

<p>The open-resource methods don’t have an argument specifying the access
mode, as the open-file methods do, because resource files can only be
opened for reading. Since it’s not possible to open a resource in any
mode other than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileAccessRead</code>, there’s no
need for a separate access mode argument.</p>

<p>You can open bundled resources even when the <a href="terp.html#file-safety">file
safety</a> level prohibits access to external disk
files. Resource are read-only, so you can’t use resource access to do
any damage to the local system. Reading a resource is considered
inherently safe because these objects are explicitly bundled into the
program as part of its installation, rather than being external data on
the local system.</p>

<p>The file safety level does have one effect on resource files, though. If
you attempt to open a resource file, and the resource isn’t found among
the <a href="build.html#resources">bundled resources</a>, <strong>and</strong> the file safety
level is 3 or lower (i.e., local read access is allowed), TADS attempts
to interpret the resource name as a local file path within the image
file’s directory. If the file safety level is 4 or higher (no local read
access), TADS won’t substitute local files for missing resources. This
means that it’s okay to use local file substitution during development
and testing, but you must always explicitly bundle resources into the
.t3 file when you release your game.</p>

<p>On success, these methods return a new File object that can be used
subsequently to read from the resource. On failure, they throw the same
types of exceptions as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openFileXxx()</code>
methods.</p>

<h2 id="local-system-file-naming-rules"><span id="namingRules"></span>Local system file naming rules</h2>

<p>The rules for naming files can vary quite a bit between operating
systems. Since TADS runs on many systems, you should be careful that
you’re not making assumptions about file names and paths that will only
work on your own operating system.</p>

<p>One way to be sure that a filename is valid locally is to let the user
specify the name, rather than hard-coding it as a string within your
program. You can let the user specify a name by asking them to type it
in via <a href="tadsio.html#inputLine">inputLine()</a>, or better still, by
presenting a local system file dialog using
<a href="tadsio.html#inputFile">inputFile()</a> function.</p>

<p>For files that you create and manage for your program’s own internal
use, you probably won’t want to ask the user to name them. For these
sorts of files you’ll need to hard-code their names. The best way to
maximize portability is to use a least common denominator approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid most punctuation marks in file names. To be completely safe, use
only letters and digits; but you’ll be safe on Windows, Mac OS, and
Linux if you avoid these: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\* + ? = \[ \] / \\ &amp; \|
" : \&lt; \&gt;</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stick to ASCII characters - avoid accented letters, for example. Most
modern systems allow Latin-1 or Unicode characters in file names, but
character set handling in file names is tricky at best, so it’s
easiest to avoid the issue by using only the ASCII subset.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shorter names are safer. Most systems these days allow very long file
names, so in practice you probably won’t actually bump up against any
limits; but when there’s no dire need for a long name, you might want
to keep names relatively short just to be safe, in the range of 20
characters or so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t hard-code directory paths based on your own operating system’s
path syntax, because path syntax varies across platforms. It probably
goes without saying, but you should never hard-code “absolute” paths
that start in the root directory, such as “/tads/games” or
“C:\TADS\GAMES” - you obviously can’t count on every machine having
the same top-level folder tree that you use. More subtly, you
shouldn’t even write relative sub-folder paths using your local OS
syntax, because that syntax won’t work when users run your program on
other systems. For example, if you write your program on Windows, you
might think it’s okay to write a relative path like “data\stats.txt”.
It’s not okay! That backslash won’t work on Unix or Mac systems.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, there’s a way around this problem: use
<a href="filename.html#fromUniversal">FileName.fromUniversal()</a> to create local
paths based on a portable “universal” syntax.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="special-files"><span id="specialFiles"></span>Special Files</h2>

<p>In most cases, you open a file by referring to a particular filename and
location (such as a directory path) in the local file system. In
addition, there are certain “special” files that you can access. You
don’t refer to these files by name, but rather by purpose; you tell the
interpreter which special file you want, and the interpreter figures out
where the file is and what it’s called. The purpose of this layer of
indirection is that it allows the interpreter to choose the right name
for the file, given its purpose, based on local conventions.</p>

<p>To open a special file, you simply pass in the special file identifier
(defined in file.h) in place of the <em>filename</em> argument to one of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openFileXxx()</code> methods. Here are the special
files currently defined:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LibraryDefaultsFile</code> - this file stores
global default values for library preference settings. A game library
(e.g., Adv3) can use this file as a repository of default option
settings. The settings file is shared across games, so that a user’s
preference settings automatically transfer to each new game played.
The interpreter determines the directory location where this file is
stored.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WebUIPrefsFile</code> - this file stores the
display style settings for the Web UI. This file is shared across
games, so that a user’s display customizations are preserved when
starting a new game. This file is stored in the same location as the
library defaults file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Special files aren’t subject to <a href="terp.html#file-safety">file safety</a>
restrictions. These files are limited to the specific names and
locations designated by the interpreter, so it’s not possible for a T3
program to use a special file to access arbitrary file system data. Each
special file represents some functionality that might be impossible for
T3 programs to implement with normal files under high file safety
settings; special files allow the interpreter to provide the
functionality without the risks of lowering the safety settings.</p>

<h2 id="temporary-files"><span id="tempfiles"></span>Temporary files</h2>

<p>It’s sometimes convenient to store certain working data in external
files rather than in memory. For example, some data sets can grow so
large that it can be taxing on system performance to keep them in
memory. Temporary files are the usual answer to such situations.</p>

<p>TADS lets you generate names for temporary files using the
<a href="tempfile.html">TemporaryFile</a> class. A TemporaryFile object represents
the name of a temporary file, and automatically keeps track of the file
to ensure that it’s deleted when the program exits or no longer needs
access to the file. Once you’ve created a TemporaryFile object
representing a filename, you can pass the TemporaryFile to any of the
File “open” methods to open the file for read or write access:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local temp = new TemporaryFile();
    local f = File.openTextFile(temp, FileAccessWrite, 'ascii');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Temporary files have two major benefits. First, the system automatically
ensures that they’re deleted by the time the program exits, so you don’t
have to worry about explicitly cleaning up the disk space you use for
these files. Second, temporary files bypass the <a href="terp.html#file-safety">file
safety</a> settings, so you can use them even when
the file safety settings would prohibit the same access to ordinary
files. Temporary files are an exception to the usual safety rules
because they’re already protected from misuse by their design: the
system controls the name and location of a temporary file, so it’s not
possible to use them to access or change any existing local file system
data.</p>

<p>File Spec objects</p>

<p>Traditionally, the way to specify a file’s identity in TADS was simply
to supply a string containing a filename, written using the local
operating system’s conventions for naming files. A file in TADS very
straightforwardly represented a file on the local machine’s hard disk,
so naturally a file identifier was nothing more than a local filename
string.</p>

<p>With the addition of the Web UI infrastruture in TADS 3.1, we’ve had to
make the interfaces a little more abstract. It’s no longer always the
case that files are stored on a local disk. In the Web UI world, there
are more ways of storing external data:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#tempfiles">Temporary files</a>. These are physically stored on the
local disk, like traditional files. But they have some additional
special features, such as automatic deletion when you’re done with
them.</li>
  <li>Remote “cloud” files. When running in a client/server configuration,
TADS can store files on a remote machine, known as a <a href="webdeploy.html#storageServer">storage
server</a>, rather than on a local disk.
Some people call this “cloud” storage, since from the user’s
perspective they’re stored out in some nebulous location on the
network, and the user doesn’t need to know the details of exactly
where. At the File level, TADS makes this transparent; you just
operate on File objects as normal, and TADS takes care of moving data
to and from the remote server. However, there are differences at the
UI level.</li>
  <li>Client files. It’s also possible to use the client/server
configuration <em>without</em> a storage server. In this setup, files are
stored on the user’s client machine, rather than on the machine
running the game. File transfers to and from the client are
accomplished via HTTP uploads and downloads.</li>
</ul>

<p>To handle this expanded range of storage options, TADS 3.1 has a more
abstract way of representing file identities. As we saw earlier, the
File “open” methods accept more than just filename strings: they also
accept TemporaryFile objects, and something called File Spec interfaces.</p>

<p>A File Spec interface is designed to give your program a way of creating
new external storage types, beyond what’s built into the system. TADS
has built-in handling for ordinary local files, temporary files, and
“cloud” files. File Spec interfaces let you build your own additional
types.</p>

<p>In concrete terms, a File Spec is really pretty simple. It’s just a
<a href="tadsobj.html">TadsObject</a> object that has one required method and one
optional method:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getFilename()</code> returns a system file
identifier: either a string containing a filename, or a TemporaryFile
object. When the system wants to open the underlying disk file, it
calls this method to find out where on disk to read or write the data.
This method is required.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">closeFile()</code> is optional. When the system
closes the underlying disk file, it calls this method to let you know.
This gives you a chance to perform any desired post-processing on the
file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic idea behind the File Spec is that you can use it to identify
an external storage object that requires special handling beyond just
reading or writing a file on disk. For the actual byte storage, you have
to use some kind of normal disk file; in practice this is usually a
temporary file identified by a TemporaryFile object, but it could just
as well be an ordinary disk file. What the File Spec adds is the ability
to apply some special pre-processing or post-processing to the file.
This could involve moving the data to or from some other storage
location, synthesizing the data from scratch just before it’s accessed,
or making use of the data after the file has been written.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of how this feature can be used. The Adv3 Web UI uses
the File Spec mechanism to implement client-side storage; this is an
example of the post-processing capability, where we initially create the
file as a local temporary file but then move it somewhere else when
we’re done with it. When the user types SAVE, the library would normally
display a file selector dialog asking for a file for saving the game.
With client-side files, the library instead just creates a custom object
with the File Spec methods, and creates a TemporaryFile object to go
with it. The library uses this special object to call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saveGame()</code>. When
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saveGame()</code> opens the file, it calls
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getFilename()</code> on the File Spec object, which
returns the TemporaryFile; this means that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saveGame()</code> ends up saving the current game
state to the temporary file on the server machine. When the save is
finished, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saveGame()</code> closes the file, which
calls the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">closeFile()</code> method on the File Spec
object. The File Spec object’s implementation of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">closeFile()</code> finishes the operation by sending
information about the newly available file to the Web UI client, which
responds by offering the user a chance to download and save the file.
The result from the user’s perspective is the SAVE command offers a
“save file” dialog that saves the game to the local hard disk, just as
in the traditional stand-alone interpreter.</p>

<h2 id="file-methods">File methods</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">closeFile()</code></p>

<p>Close the file. This flushes internal buffers to the external storage
device and releases all operating system resources associated with the
open file. On many operating systems, when a program is working with a
file, other programs are not allowed to access the same file, to prevent
any data corruption that would occur if multiple programs were accessing
the same data simultaneously without coordinating their activities;
closing a file tells the operating system that your program is finished
with the file, and that it is therefore safe to allow other programs to
access the file. You are not strictly required to call this method when
finished with a file, because TADS will automatically close the file
when the garbage collector determines that the File object is no longer
usable; however, this could result in consuming system resources for
much longer than necessary, so it is always good programming practice to
close files explicitly as soon as you know you’re done with them.</p>

<p>After closing a file, no further operations can be performed on the
closed File object. Any subsequent operations on the File object will
throw a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileClosedException</code>. (This doesn’t
mean that you can’t do more work on the underlying operating system
file - it simply means that you have to open it again with a new File
object.)</p>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">closeFile()</code> can throw an error. The
only situation where an error can usually occur on close is when the
file was opened for writing, and you’ve made updates. In this case, the
system might have buffered (delayed) some of the physical updates to the
underlying media, and will attempt to complete them on closing the file.
This is where there’s a potential for trouble, since something could go
wrong writing the final updates to disk. For example, the disk might be
too full, or the write might encounter a hardware media error. If an
error does occur, the File object is still marked as closed, so no
further operations on the File will be allowed - but the actual
underlying disk file could be in an inconsistent state. It’s difficult
in general to correct these sorts of errors programmatically, but it’s
often worth notifying the user so they’re aware of the possible data
loss right away.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deleteFile(*filename*)</code></p>

<p>Deletes the file with the given name. This erases the file from the disk
or other media. <em>filename</em> is a string giving the name of the file, or
one of the special file identifiers. This is a static function that you
call directly on the File object:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    File.deleteFile('myfile.txt');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The function will succeed only if the <a href="terp.html#file-safety">file
safety</a> level would allow you to open the file
with write access. If not, the method throws a file safety exception. In
addition, the function will fail if the file can’t be deleted at the
operating system level. There are numerous reasons that the deletion can
fail at the OS level: insufficient privileges or access rights,
read-only protection on the file, physical media failures, and
concurrent access by other programs, to name a few.</p>

<p>See the <a href="filename.html">FileName</a> class for a more comprehensive set of
file manipulation functions.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">digestMD5(*length*?)</code></p>

<p>Calculates the MD5 digest of the contents of the file, starting at the
current seek location and including <em>length</em> bytes from the file. If
<em>length</em> is omitted or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, the entire rest of
the file (from the current seek position to the end of the file) is
included in the digest.</p>

<p>Returns a string of 32 hex digits with the digest result. This method
has the side effect of reading bytes from the file, so on return the
seek position is set to the next byte after the bytes digested.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getCharacterSet()</code></p>

<p>Returns the CharacterSet object that the file is using for its character
translations. This is useful only with files in text format.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getFileMode()</code></p>

<p>Returns the file’s current data mode. The return value is one of the
following constants:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileModeText</code> - text mode
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openTextFile()</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileModeData</code> - data mode
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openDataFile()</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileModeRaw</code> - raw (binary) mode
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openRawFile()</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getFileSize()</code></p>

<p>Returns the size in bytes of the file. This is the size of the file as
it appears on disk, so this might not be the same as the apparent size
of the file’s data stream as the program sees it; for example, if the
file is being read as a text file, character set translations and
newline format conversions will usually make the in-memory
representation differ somewhat from the binary representation on disk.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getPos()</code></p>

<p>Returns an integer giving the current read/write position in the file;
this is simply the byte offset in the file of the next read or write
operation. When a file is first opened, this will return zero, because
the first read or write operation will occur at the first byte of the
file, which is at offset zero.</p>

<p><span id="getRootName"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getRootName(*filename*)</code></p>

<p>Note: we recommended using the newer
<a href="filename.html#getBaseName">FileName.getBaseName()</a> instead of this
method; the FileName class provides a more comprehensive set of file
name functions.</p>

<p>Returns a string giving the “root” name of <em>filename</em>, using the local
system’s directory path conventions. <em>filename</em> is a string giving the
name of a file in the local file system.</p>

<p>This is a static method, so you call it on the File object itself:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local root = File.getRootName(filename);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The root name of a file, also called the base name, is the portion of
the filename string excluding any directory location or folder path. The
directory path syntax varies by operating system; this method parses the
name according to the syntax rules for the local host at run-time. For
example, when running on a Windows machine,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File.getRootName('a\\b\\c.txt')</code> returns
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'c.txt'</code>. The same program running on a Linux
machine will return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a\\b\\c.txt'</code> for the same
function, because the backslash isn’t a path separator character on
Linux.</p>

<p>This method only does superficial parsing; it doesn’t actually check
that the path or file exist.</p>

<p>Note that you should never hard-code a filename with a path into your
program, precisely because of the varying naming rules on different
systems. However, you might from time to time still encounter a filename
string containing a path, from sources such as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputFile()</code> or the program startup arguments.</p>

<p><span id="packBytes"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packBytes(*format*, ...)</code></p>

<p>Converts data values into bytes, according to your format
specifications, and writes the bytes to the file.</p>

<p><em>format</em> is the format string, which specifies the binary encoding to
use for each value to be packed. The remaining arguments are the values
to be packed, which correspond to items in the format string.</p>

<p>The return value is the number of bytes written. (More precisely, it’s
the difference between the file position at the start and end of the
method. If you use a positioning code like X or @, you can move the file
position backwards, in which case the return value might be smaller than
the number of bytes actually written.)</p>

<p>See <a href="pack.html">Byte Packing</a> for full details.</p>

<p><span id="readBytes"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readBytes(*byteArr*, *start*?, *cnt*?)</code></p>

<p>This function, which is used only for raw files, reads bytes from the
file into <em>byteArr</em>, which must be an object of intrinsic class
ByteArray. If <em>start</em> and <em>cnt</em> are given, they give the starting index
in the byte array at which the bytes are to be stored and the number of
bytes to be read; if these are omitted, the function reads as many bytes
from the file as there are bytes in the byte array, and stores them in
the byte array starting at its first element (index 1).</p>

<p>This function returns the number of bytes actually read from the file.
If the end of the file is encountered before the request is fulfilled,
the return value will be smaller than the number of bytes requested. If
the function returns zero, it simply means that there are no more bytes
available in the file.</p>

<p>Note that if the file is open for write-only access, a FileModeException
will be thrown.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readFile()</code></p>

<p>Reads data from the file and returns the value. This function reads data
according to the file’s format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Text format: the next line of text is read from the file and returned
as a string. The line ends at the next “newline” character or
sequence.</p>

    <p>TADS recognizes newlines according to local platform conventions. For
example, on Windows platforms, TADS considers each CR-LF pair to
represent a single newline sequence. TADS translates the local newline
sequence to ‘\n’, so each string returned from readFile() will always
end in a single ‘\n’, regardless of the local platform conventions.
This ensures that your code doesn’t have to worry about different
conventions on different machines; it’ll run the same way everywhere.
Note that if the file ends in mid-line, without a terminating newline
sequence within the file itself, readFile() likewise will return the
last string without a ‘\n’ character at the end. This is done so that
the readFile() results accurately reflect what’s in the file, in case
it’s important to you whether or not the file ends in a final newline
sequence.</p>

    <p>The characters read from the file are translated through the currently
active character set, so the returned string is always a valid Unicode
string, regardless of the character set of the external file. This
means that you don’t have to worry about character set differences on
different platforms, apart from making sure that the proper character
set is specified when opening the file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data format: the next data item is read from the file and returned.
The return value will be of the same type as the value that was
originally written to the file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Raw format: this function is not allowed for raw files (a
FileModeException is thrown if this is attempted on a raw file).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, when the end of the file is reached, the function returns
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>. If any error occurs reading the file, the
method throws a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileIOException</code>.</p>

<p>Note that if the file is open for write-only access, a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileModeException</code> will be thrown.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setCharacterSet(*charset*)</code></p>

<p>Sets the character mapping that the file uses for its character
translations. <em>charset</em> can be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="charset.html">CharacterSet</a> object.</li>
  <li>A string giving a character mapping name. A CharacterSet object is
automatically created for the mapping name.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>. This selects the local system’s default
character set for text files.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setFileMode(*mode*, *charset*?)</code></p>

<p>Change the file mode. <em>mode</em> is a FileModeXxx value giving the desired
new file mode (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileModeText</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileModeData</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileModeRaw</code>).</p>

<p>If the <em>mode</em> value is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileModeText</code>, <em>charset</em>
specifies the character set for the file’s contents. Any text you write
to the file will be mapped to this character set, and any text you read
from the file will be converted from this character set. The character
set can be specified as a
<a href="charset.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CharacterSet</code></a> object, or as a
string giving the name of a character set. If <em>charset</em> is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or the argument is omitted entirely, the
local system’s default character set for file contents is used.</p>

<p>After you switch modes, subsequent read and write operations will
interpret the file’s contents according to the new mode.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setPos(*pos*)</code></p>

<p>Set the read/write position in the file to <em>pos</em>, which is an integer
giving a byte offset in the file. The first byte in the file is at
offset zero.</p>

<p>For text and data format files, this function should be used with
caution. In particular, you should only use this function to set a file
position that was previously returned from a call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getPos()</code>. Text and data format files have data
structures that span multiple bytes in the file, so setting the file to
an arbitrary byte position could cause the next read or write to occur
in the middle of one of these multi-byte structures, which could corrupt
the file or cause data read to be misinterpreted.</p>

<p>For raw files, your program is responsible for the exact byte layout of
the file, so you can set the read/write position wherever you want
without confusing the File object. However, if you’re defining your own
multi-byte structures, you naturally have to be careful to move the file
position only to the proper boundaries within your own structures.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setPosEnd()</code></p>

<p>Sets the read/write position in the file to the end of the file. Any
subsequent writing to the file will place new bytes after the last
existing byte in the file. This function is useful if you want to add
new data after all of the existing data in a file, and is also useful to
determine the size of a file (which you can do by seeking to the end of
the file and then using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getPos()</code> to determine
the new position in the file).</p>

<p>Note that the warnings mentioned in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setPos()</code>
regarding valid positions generally don’t apply to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setPosEnd()</code>. It is usually safe to go to the
end of a file, because whatever multi-byte data structures occur in the
file should be complete units, hence moving to the end of the file
should set the position to the end of the last structure.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sha256(*length*?)</code></p>

<p>Calculates the 256-bit SHA-2 hash of the contents of the file, starting
at the current seek location and hashing <em>length</em> bytes from the file.
If <em>length</em> is omitted or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, the entire rest
of the file (from the current seek position to the end of the file) is
hashed.</p>

<p>Returns a string of 64 hex digits with the hash result. This method has
the side effect of reading bytes from the file for the hash, so on
return the seek position is set to the next byte after the bytes hashed.</p>

<p><span id="unpackBytes"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unpackBytes(*format*)</code></p>

<p>Reads bytes from the file, and converts them to data values according to
your format specifications. Returns a list of the converted values.</p>

<p><em>format</em> is the format string, which specifies the binary encoding to
parse for each value to be unpacked.</p>

<p>The number of bytes read from the file depends on the format string. The
method reads just enough bytes to provide a value for each item in the
format string. An error is thrown if the file doesn’t have enough data
to satisfy the format string.</p>

<p>See <a href="pack.html">Byte Packing</a> for full details.</p>

<p><span id="writeBytes"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeBytes(*source*, *start*?, *cnt*?)</code></p>

<p>This function, which is used only for raw files, writes a range of bytes
to the file from the given <em>source</em> object. <em>source</em> must be one of the
following object types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ByteArray</code>: the specified range of bytes from
the byte array is written to the file. <em>start</em> is the index within the
byte array of the first byte of the range to copy to the file; if
omitted, the default index is 1 (i.e., the first byte of the array).
<em>cnt</em> is the number of bytes to write; if omitted, all bytes from the
starting index to the end of the array are copied.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File</code>: bytes are read from the <em>source</em> file
and written to the target file. The source file must be open with read
access, and it must be in “raw” mode, since this function reads
individual bytes from the file without any character set or data type
translation. <em>start</em> is a seek location within the source file; if
it’s omitted, the default is the current seek position in the file
(the location that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getPos()</code> returns). <em>cnt</em>
is the number of bytes to copy; if omitted, the file’s entire contents
from the starting seek position to the end of the file are copied.</li>
</ul>

<p>This function has no return value; if any error occurs writing the
bytes, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileIOException</code> is thrown. If the
source object is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File</code>, a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileIOException</code> can also result if any errors
occur reading the source object.</p>

<p>Note that if the file is open for read-only access, a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileModeException</code> will be thrown.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeFile(*val*)</code></p>

<p>Writes the value <em>val</em> to the file. The value is written according to
the file’s format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Text format: val is converted into a string using the default
conversion for its type if it’s not already a string; if the value is
not convertible to a string, the function throws a runtime exception.
The string is written to the file by translating its characters to the
local character set through the currently active character set object
for the file.</li>
  <li>Data format: the value can be an integer, string, enum, BigNumber,
ByteArray, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> value. The value is
written in the private TADS data-file format so that it can be read
back later with the readFile() method.</li>
  <li>Raw format: this function is not allowed for raw files (a
FileModeException is thrown if this is attempted on a raw file).</li>
</ul>

<p>Writing an enumerator value to a data format file ties the file to the
particular version of your program that wrote the file. When you compile
your program, the compiler assigns an arbitrary internal identifier
value to each enumerator, and it is this arbitrary internal value that
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeFile()</code> function stores in the file.
When you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readFile()</code> to read an enumerator
value, the system uses the current internal enumerator value assignments
made by the compiler. Because these values are arbitrary, they can vary
from one compilation to the next, so it is not guaranteed that a file
containing enumerators can be correctly read after you have recompiled
your program. For this reason, you should never write enumerators to a
file unless you’re certain that the file will only be used by the
identical version of your program (so it’s safe, for example, to use
enumerators in a temporary file that you’ll read back during the same
run of the program). If you must store enumerators in a file that might
be read by a future version of your program, you should use some
mechanism (such as reflection) to translate enumerator values into
integers, strings, or other values that you define and can therefore
keep stable as you modify your program.</p>

<p>If any error occurs writing the data, such as running out of disk space,
the method throws a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileIOException</code>. If the
file is open for read-only access, a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileModeException</code> is thrown.</p>

<h2 id="interaction-with-saverestore-undo-and-restart">Interaction with save/restore, undo, and restart</h2>

<p>File objects are inherently transient; all instances returned from the
creation methods (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openTextFile()</code>, etc.) are
transient and thus not affected by save, restore, restart, or undo.</p>

<p>If a File instance is part of the program when pre-initialization
completes, and is thus saved to the final image file, the instance will
be “unsynchronized” when the program is loaded. This means that the File
object no longer refers to an open operating system file - once the
object has been saved with the image file and then reloaded, there is
obviously no longer an active association with the system file. When a
File object becomes unsynchronized, it will no longer allow any
operation that could be affected by the inconsistency. In particular,
the file cannot be read or written once it is unsynchronized. To enforce
this, the File object throws a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileSyncException</code> if any of these operations
are attempted on an unsynchronized file.</p>
