<h1 id="byte-packing">Byte Packing</h1>

<p>Byte packing is a new feature in TADS 3.1 designed to simplify binary
file manipulation. The byte packer lets you read and write complex data
structures in binary files with very compact code. You don’t have to
manually twiddle bits or shuffle bytes; the byte packer provides
automatic translations between TADS datatypes and many common byte
formats. It’s not tied to any set of pre-defined file formats, either -
it’s really a “mini language” that makes it possible to read and write
almost any binary file format you’re likely to come across.</p>

<p>The TADS byte packer is based on the similar facilities in Perl and php.
If you know one of those languages, you’ll find all of this pretty
familiar - but be aware that there are some differences, so you should
at least read the reference section below.</p>

<p>If you’re not already familiar with the basic ideas from Perl or php,
skip down past the reference tables, and you’ll find a full tutorial
introduction.</p>

<h3 id="type-codes">Type codes</h3>

<p>a</p>

<p>Latin-1 character string, padded with null bytes. When unpacking, null
bytes are removed from the end of the string.</p>

<p>A</p>

<p>Latin-1 character string, padded with spaces. When unpacking, trailing
spaces are removed from the end of the string.</p>

<p>b</p>

<p>Byte string. The source value for packing can be a string or ByteArray;
if a string, each character is packed as a byte, so all characters must
be in the Unicode range 0 to 255. Unpacks as a ByteArray.</p>

<p>c</p>

<p>8-bit signed integer (“char”, in C terminology), -128 to 127; unpacks to
integer. Packs to one byte.</p>

<p>C</p>

<p>8-bit unsigned integer, 0 to 255; unpacks to integer.</p>

<p>d</p>

<p>Double-precision floating point number (“double” in C). Packed in
standard IEEE 754-2008 64-bit binary interchange format, but in
little-endian byte order. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d\&gt;</code> to pack in
the IEEE standard big-endian order. Packs to 8 bytes; unpacks as
BigNumber. This type can store about 16 decimal digits of precision, and
can represent absolute values up to 1.7976931348623158e+308.</p>

<p>f</p>

<p>Single-precision floating point number (“float” in C). Packed in
standard IEEE 754-2008 32-bit binary interchange format, but in
little-endian byte order. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d\&gt;</code> to pack in
the IEEE standard big-endian order. Packs to 4 bytes; unpacks as
BigNumber. This type can store about 7 decimal digits of precision, and
can represent absolute values up to 3.402823466e+38F.</p>

<p>h</p>

<p>Packs from a string containing hexadecimal digits to a byte string,
packing two hex digits into each byte. The digits are packed low nibble
first: e.g., the string ‘14’ is packed into a byte value 0x41, which is
the ASCII character ‘A’. A repeat count gives the length in hex digits
for the unpacked string, but the “!” suffix changes this to the packed
byte length.</p>

<p>H</p>

<p>Same as ‘h’, but packs the high nibble of each digit pair first: e.g.,
the string ‘41’ is packed into byte value 0x41.</p>

<p>k</p>

<p>Compressed unsigned integer value. Packs as a series of base-128 (7-bit)
“digits”, one digit per byte, most significant byte first; the 8th bit
(0x80) is set on each byte except the last, to indicate where the value
ends. Unpacks as a regular integer if the value fits in a 32-bit signed
value, otherwise unpacks as BigNumber. This format can in principle
store values of unlimited size, but there’s an implementation limit of
about 10<sup>500</sup>. Only unsigned (non-negative) values can be
stored with this type.</p>

<p>l</p>

<p>32-bit signed integer (“long” in C terms), -2,147,483,648o to
2,147,483,647; unpacks as an integer. Packs to four bytes.</p>

<p>L</p>

<p>32-bit unsigned integer, 0 to 4,294,967,295. Unpacks as BigNumber, since
a regular TADS integer can only store positive values up to
2,147,483,647.</p>

<p>q</p>

<p>64-bit signed integer (“quad word”), -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to
9,223,372,036,854,775,807; unpacks as BigNumber. Packs to eight bytes.</p>

<p>Q</p>

<p>64-bit unsigned integer, 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.</p>

<p>s</p>

<p>16-bit signed integer (“short” in C terms), -32,768 to 32,767; unpacks
as an integer. Packs to two bytes.</p>

<p>S</p>

<p>16-bit unsigned integer, 0 to 65,535; unpacks as integer.</p>

<p>u</p>

<p>UTF-8 character string, padded with null bytes. The length is in bytes
in UTF-8 notation.</p>

<p>U</p>

<p>UTF-8 character string, padded with spaces.</p>

<p>w</p>

<p>“Wide character” Unicode string, in UCS-2 format, 16 bits per character;
padded with null characters. The length is in characters, but the “!”
suffix changes to the packed byte length (two bytes per character). The
default byte order is little-endian; use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w\&gt;</code>
for big-endian.</p>

<p>W</p>

<p>Wide characters, UCS-2 format, padded with space characters.</p>

<p>x</p>

<p>Packs a null byte; on unpack, skips forward by one byte in the file.
Doesn’t consume an argument value when packing, or produce a result
value when unpacking. If there’s a count suffix, packs or skips that
many bytes. With “!”, packs null bytes or skips bytes to the given
alignment boundary, relative to the start of the current format string.</p>

<p>X</p>

<p>Skips backwards one byte in the file; doesn’t consume an argument value
or produce a result value. With a count suffix, skips backwards by that
many bytes. With “!”, skips back to the nearest previous alignment
boundary.</p>

<p>@</p>

<p>Moves the file pointer to a byte offset from the start of the current
group (in parentheses or square brackets), or from the start of the
format string if not in a group. The offset is given as the suffix:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@15</code> moves to byte offset 15. When packing, if
the position is moved forward, the bytes from the current position to
the new position are filled with null bytes. Each iteration of a
repeated group resets the zero point for the group. If the ! qualifier
is used (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@15!</code>, the position is relative
start of the entire format string rather than the current group.</p>

<p>When unpacking, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@?</code> returns the current byte
offset in the file relative to the current group, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@!?</code> returns the offset relative to the whole
format string. These codes do nothing when packing.</p>

<p>“<em>text</em>”</p>

<p>Packs the literal bytes <em>text</em>. Each character in <em>text</em> is treated as a
byte value, so <em>text</em> can only contain characters in the Unicode range
0-255. To use a quote mark (“) within <em>text</em>, write two in a row (“”).</p>

<p>On unpacking, this simply skips the number of bytes implied by <em>text</em>.
This doesn’t return any value in the result list, and it doesn’t check
that the bytes in the file actually match the literal bytes given.</p>

<p>{<em>hex-digits</em>}</p>

<p>Packs the literal bytes encoded by the series of hex digit pairs. For
example, ` ‘{4142434445}’` packs the bytes
“ABCDE”, since 0x41 is the ASCII code for “A”, 0x42 for “B”, etc.</p>

<p>On unpacking, this simply skips the number of bytes implied by the digit
string. This doesn’t return any value in the result list, and it doesn’t
check that the bytes in the file actually match the literal bytes given.</p>

<h3 id="qualifiers">Qualifiers</h3>

<p>A type code can be followed by one or more qualifiers. The order of the
qualifiers doesn’t matter.</p>

<p><em>number</em></p>

<p>For integer and floating point types (cCsSlLqQdf), specifies the repeat
count: the given number of values are written. E.g.,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s5</code> packs five 16-bit integer values.</p>

<p>For string types (aAbuUwWhH), the number qualifier specifies the length
of the <strong>unpacked</strong> string. For aAbuU, the length is in bytes; for wW,
it’s in characters; for hH, it’s in hex digits in the unpacked string.
The “!” qualifier changes the count to reflect the <strong>packed byte
length</strong> for wWhH.</p>

<p>For padding (xX), specifies the number of bytes to skip.</p>

<p>For positioning (@), specifies the offset from the start of the group
(or the start of the format string, if not in a group).</p>

<p>Combining the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\*</code> qualifier with a number
qualifier (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H30\*</code>) makes the number an
upper limit when unpacking (and has no effect when packing); see below.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>In place of a numeric qualifier, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\*</code> means
“infinity” for the count or length. Packs all remaining argument values
for a numeric type, or the full string for a string type. Unpacks the
entire rest of the file.</p>

<p>You can also combine * with a numeric count for unpacking, as in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H30\*</code>. The combination of a number and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\*</code> means to unpack <em>up to</em> the numeric limit,
but stop earlier if there’s not enough source material to fulfill the
count. Normally, trying to unpack more items than are actually available
would cause an error, because the unpacker would try to read past the
end of the source bytes. When using a count and * with a multi-byte
item (such as one of the integer types) or a group, the file must end
exactly at an item or group boundary - that is, there must not be any
extraneous extra bytes after the last item. This is because the unpacker
checks to see if it has reached the very end of the source object just
before unpacking each iteration of the repeated item; if extraneous
bytes follow the last item or group, the unpacker will think there’s
another item available and will go ahead with unpacking it, triggering a
read error when the end of the source object is encountered midway
through the iteration.</p>

<p>:<em>type</em></p>

<p>(where <em>type</em> is one of the type codes listed above, such as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">q</code> for a quad-word integer) Equivalent to
specifying the packed byte length of the given type as a numeric repeat
count. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:q</code> is equivalent to a
repeat count of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8</code>, because the packed size of
the q type is 8 bytes. This is most useful with the x and X codes (e.g.,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X:q</code> skips backwards 8 bytes), but can be used
with any item.</p>

<p>0</p>

<p>For types auwhH, specifies null termination as the length indicator.
When packing, a null byte (or a two-byte null character, for type ‘w’)
is added after the end of the string. When unpacking, the length is
determined by reading characters until reaching the null terminator.
Unpacking skips the null terminator in the file, and doesn’t include it
in the result value.</p>

<p>‘0’ can be combined with a fixed length by adding the length qualifier
after the ‘0’, as in ‘a015’. This packs a fixed-width string as normal,
then adds the null terminator (so ‘a015’ packs to 16 bytes). When
unpacking, the null terminator is simply skipped.</p>

<p>Not allowed for other types.</p>

<p>!</p>

<p>For wide character (wW) and hex digit (hH) string types, changes the
length count into a byte length.</p>

<p>For padding (xX), changes the length count into an alignment size. E.g.,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x4!</code> pads just enough to position the next byte
at a multiple of 4 bytes from the start of the format string.</p>

<p>For positioning (@), makes the position relative to the start of the
entire format string (rather than the current group).</p>

<p>When unpacking a square bracketed group, specifies that <em>each iteration</em>
of the group is to be unpacked into a sublist, rather than unpacking the
whole group into a single sublist. For example, unpacking
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[L S\]3!</code> returns a list of three sublists,
each of which contains two elements (a long integer and a short
integer).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code></p>

<p>Changes @ to a query operator: when unpacking,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@?</code> returns an integer value giving the current
byte offset within the file, relative to the start of the current group,
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@?!</code> returns the file offset relative to
the start of the entire format string.</p>

<p>Has no effect with other types.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;</code></p>

<p>Change the byte order of a multi-byte type to big-endian. For integers,
the most significant byte of the value is packed first. For
floating-point numbers, packs the byte with the sign bit and exponent
first, followed by the mantissa bytes from most to least significant.
For wide Unicode strings, packs the more significant byte of each
character first (this doesn’t change the order of the characters
themselves, though, obviously).</p>

<p>This can be applied to a group, in which case it makes everything in the
group big-endian by default.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;</code></p>

<p>Use little-endian byte order. This is the default for all types, but
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;</code> can be used to override the order for an
item within a group that has the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;</code> qualifier,
because everything within a group inherits the endian-ness of the group.
For integers, this packs the least significant byte first. For
floating-point numbers, it packs the mantissa bytes first, from least
significant to most significant, followed by the byte with the sign bit
and exponent. For wide Unicode strings, packs the less significant byte
of each character first.</p>

<p>This can be applied to a group, in which case it makes everything within
the group little-endian by default.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code></p>

<p>When unpacking an integer type, uses the smallest type that will hold
the value. Specifically, when unpacking L, q, and Q, returns an integer
value if the packed value fits in a 32-bit signed integer
(-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647), otherwise returns a BigNumber. These
types always return BigNumber by default, even for values that would fit
an integer.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> can be applied to a parenthesized or
square-bracketed group, in which case it applies to each individual item
within the group.</p>

<p>This qualifier has no effect when packing.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code></p>

<p>When packing values, ignores type limit overflows, and instead packs a
truncated value. The value stored in case of overflow depends on the
type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integers (cCsSlLqQ): a value that’s too large for the type is
“truncated” by dropping the most significant bits until it fits. For
example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packBytes('s%', 0x12345678)</code> will
pack the value 0x5678, dropping all but the low-order 16 bits.</li>
  <li>Character and byte strings (aAb): The qualifier affects each character
individually in the string. Each character that’s outside the 0-255
range is truncated to 8 bits unsigned.</li>
  <li>Floating point (df): A value that’s too large to represent in the IEEE
754-2008 format is stored as “infinity”, which is a special,
distinguished value within the IEEE and BigNumber type systems.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> can be applied to a parenthesized or
square-bracketed group, in which case it applies to each individual item
within the group.</p>

<p>This qualifier has no effect when unpacking. The default packing
behavior when this qualifier isn’t specified is to thrown an error on
overflow.</p>

<h3 id="other-syntax">Other syntax</h3>

<p>( )</p>

<p>Parentheses group a set of items. Groups can be repeated by using a
count suffix, as in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(l s)3</code>, or a length
prefix, as in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C/(l s)</code>.</p>

<p>The following attributes can be applied to a group:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code>. Attributes
applied to a group are inherited by everything within the group. For
example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(l s q)\&gt;</code> is equivalent to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l\&gt; s\&gt; q\&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>[ ]</p>

<p>Square brackets group items the same as parentheses, but indicate that
the grouped items are taken from a list in the packing arguments, or
unpacked into a list in the unpacking results. For example, unpacking
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'s \[l\]3 s</code>’ might return
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[1, \[2, 3, 4\], 5\]</code>.</p>

<p>As with parenthesized groups, when any of the qualifiers
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> are applied to
the group, they’re inherited by all items within the group.</p>

<p>If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code> modifier is used, each iteration of
the group is packed from or unpacked into a separate sublist. Without
this modifier, the entire group is packed/unpacked as a single sublist.</p>

<p>/</p>

<p>Count prefix. Use the syntax <em>count-type</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>
<em>repeated-item</em>. The <em>count-type</em> value is packed first, as a length
prefix, then the repeated items are packed:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fp.packBytes('S/l', 100, 200, 300)</code> packs an
unsigned 16-bit integer “3” as the number of items, then three 32-bit
integers. If the repeated item is a string, the count is the length of
the string in the normal units for the type: ‘S/a’ packs the length in
characters of string, immediately followed by the string. The repeated
item can be a group, which lets you pack a count prefix for a complex
item such as a counted-length string or group of integers: ‘S/(C/a)’
packs a prefix-counted list of prefix-length strings, ‘S/[a4 s l]’
packs a prefix-counted list of structures with three elements each.</p>

<p>Be careful when repeating a fixed-length string. When an item has both a
count prefix and a repeat count suffix, the prefix overrides the suffix.
For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C/A4</code> means “one counted-length
Latin-1 string”, because the “C/” prefix supersedes the “4” suffix. To
pack a counted-length list of four-character strings, you must use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C/(A4)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous-notes">Miscellaneous notes</h3>

<p>Spaces can be used anywhere in a format string. They’re simply ignored,
so you can use them for grouping to make the code easier to read.</p>

<p>All of the signed integer types use “two’s complement” notation in the
packed format.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-byte-packing">Introduction to byte packing</h2>

<p>The byte packer makes it easier to read and write binary files, by
taking care of the details of translating between TADS data values and
different byte formats. It provides a wide range of translations for
common byte formats, including signed and unsigned integers from 8 to 64
bits, IEEE standard single- and double-precision floating point formats,
big-endian and little-endian byte ordering for all multi-byte types,
fixed-length strings, variable-length strings using length prefixes,
ASCII, Latin-1, and Unicode strings, and more. The byte packer has a
compact and powerful programming interface that lets you read and write
complex structures with a couple of lines of code.</p>

<p>One key thing to understand is that the byte packer doesn’t have any
knowledge of any particular file format - for example, it doesn’t have a
special mode for JPEG files. It might have been convenient if it did,
but it would also be limiting, since there’s no way it could know about
every format out there (not to mention that new formats are being
invented all the time). The byte packer is more like a toolkit. Instead
of knowing about particular file formats, it knows about the common
components that make up most file formats. Taken together, these
components let you build your own readers and writers for almost any
format you might encounter.</p>

<h2 id="packing-and-unpacking">Packing and unpacking</h2>

<p>The byte packer has two basic operations: packing and unpacking. Packing
is the process of taking one or more variable values in your program
(numbers, strings, etc) and converting them to bytes in a file - you
pack the values into bytes. Unpacking is the reverse, where you read
bytes from a file and convert them into TADS values in your program.</p>

<p>You can actually pack and unpack bytes into and out of other objects
besides files - specifically ByteArrays and strings. Everything works
the same way regardless of the underlying byte storage location. So
whenever we talk about reading or writing “the file”, understand that
we’re talking generically about whatever underlying data source you’re
using.</p>

<p>You pack bytes using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packBytes()</code> method.
For files, this is a method on the File object. It’s essentially a
replacement for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeBytes()</code>. Instead of
having to prepare the individual byte values yourself, as you do with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeBytes()</code>, the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packBytes()</code> method combines the steps of
translating data values into the desired byte representation and writing
the resulting bytes to the file. (You can still use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeBytes()</code> - it’s not obsolete by any
means - and you can freely mix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packBytes()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeBytes()</code> calls for the same file. You
probably won’t need to, though, since
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packBytes()</code> can do anything
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeBytes()</code> can do, usually with a lot less
hassle.)</p>

<p>Unpacking uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unpackBytes()</code> method, which
is also a method on the File object. This method can serve as a
replacement for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readBytes()</code>. It combines the
steps of reading bytes from the file and translating them into data
values.</p>

<h2 id="format-strings">Format strings</h2>

<p>As we explained earlier, the byte packer doesn’t have a “JPEG mode” - it
doesn’t have any built-in knowledge of any particular file formats.
Instead, it relies on you to tell it how a file is structured. You have
to tell the packer two things: the TADS datatype you want, and the byte
format to use for the type. It’s not enough to just know the TADS type,
since there’s no single, universal format for any type. Even for
something as simple as an integer, there are several variations. You
have to tell the byte packer which storage variation to use for each
value.</p>

<p>The key to these conversions is called a <em>format string</em>. This is a
string that you write in a little sub-language that defines the type
conversions.</p>

<p>The format string language is pretty simple. The basic idea is that you
write one “type code” (which is a single character, usually a letter)
for each value you want to convert. The packer steps through the format
string and matches up each type code with the corresponding value in the
argument list, in order.</p>

<p>As a simple example, the type code for a 32-bit signed integer is “l”.
That’s a lower-case “L”, not a digit 1. The “L” stands for “long
integer”. This and a lot of the other type names come from the C
programming language, so if you know C they’ll be immediately intuitive,
and if you don’t know C they’ll seem pretty random. C’s type system has
integer types in several sizes - meaning the amount of memory they take
up, usually measured in bits. The smallest is the “char” type, which
sounds like it’s for character strings but is really just a small
integer type, taking up only 8 bits. The next size up is “short
integer”, which is usually 16 bits; then “long integer”, at 32 bits. The
latest generation of processors also have 64-bit integers, which C calls
“long longs” - but we call these “quads”, because they take up four
“words” of memory, and because we’re already using the letter “l” for
the 32-bit long.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the example. To write a series of integers to a file, you
write something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local fp = File.openRawFile('myfile.bin', FileAccessWrite);
    fp.packBytes('l l l', 1, 2, 3);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The format string is the first argument to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packBytes</code> - in this case, the string
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'l l l'</code>. The spaces in the string are
meaningless; you can include spaces anywhere in the string without
changing the meaning. As we’ll see shortly, items can be more complex
than a single character, so spacing things out can help make your code
more readable.</p>

<p>The code above matches up each ‘l’ in the format string to an integer
value in the argument list, and writes the value to the file as a series
of four bytes. The ‘l’ format takes a 32-bit integer value and splits it
up into four 8-bit chunks, writing each 8-bit chunk as a byte in the
file. Bytes are 8 bits each, so a 32-bit integer divides up evenly into
4 bytes. In the file, we arrange the bytes in order from least
significant (i.e., containing the lowest bit places of the number) to
most significant. So after running this code, the file contains 12
bytes, which look like this in hexadecimal format:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    01 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 03 00 00 00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To unpack this file - that is, read the bytes from the file and convert
them back into TADS data values - we use the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unpackBytes</code> method. We once again need a
format string to tell us how to interpret the bytes. Fortunately, the
unpacking format string uses exactly the same syntax as the packing
format string, so there’s no new syntax to learn for this part. In fact,
in most cases, you’ll use exactly the same format string to unpack a
given set of values that you used to pack the values in the first place.
That’s the case here:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local fp = File.openRawFile('myfile.bin', FileAccessRead);
    local vals = fp.unpackBytes('l l l');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The unpacker reads just enough bytes to satisfy the items in the format
string, converting each item into the corresponding data value. For an
integer type such as ‘l’, the unpacker converts the bytes into an
integer value. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unpackBytes()</code> function
returns a list containing the values it unpacked, in sequence, so
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vals</code> now contains the list
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[1, 2, 3\]</code>.</p>

<h3 id="repeat-counts">Repeat counts</h3>

<p>The format string syntax has a shorthand for a repeated item. Instead of
writing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'l l l'</code>, we can write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('l3', 1, 2, 3);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The “3” after the “l” means “pack (or unpack) three copies of this”. You
can use this notation with any integer or floating point type.</p>

<p>For string types, which we’ll come to shortly, you can also use a number
suffix, but it means something different. For a string, a number suffix
specifies the length of the string rather than a repeat count.</p>

<h3 id="more-on-integers">More on integers</h3>

<p>Let’s go back and take another look at the file we’ve been working on.
Recall that the bytes in the file, in hexadecimal, are:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    01 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 03 00 00 00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first integer value, 1, takes up the first four bytes of the file.
Remember that type code ‘l’ means “32-bit integer”, and 32 bits take up
4 bytes, because it’s 8 bits to the byte. The default byte ordering is
little-endian - least significant byte first - so the value 1, which we
can write in hex as 0x00000001, comes out as the byte sequence 01 00 00</p>
<ol>
  <li>The values 2 and 3 follow in the same format.</li>
</ol>

<p>It might be easier to see how endian-ness works with a larger number
that isn’t mostly zeros. Let’s take 305,419,896. Why this number?
Because it happens to have a nice hex representation: 0x12345678.
Remember elementary school and the tens place, hundreds place, thousands
place, etc.? With hex numbers we have the same idea, but of course it’s
not multiples of 10, but rather multiples of 16. In 0x12345678, the
highest “place” digit is the 1, just as in our decimal version the
highest would be the 3 in the hundred-millions place. We call this
highest-place digit the “most significant digit”, because it’s the one
that carries the biggest single slice of the number. The next most
significant hex digit is the 2, and so on down to the 8. There’s yet
another way we can look at this, which is to split up the number into
pairs of hex digits: 12 34 56 78. Now if we consider each <em>pair</em> to be a
“place”, we can see that the most significant pair is 12, and the least
significant is 78. Is it starting to make sense why we wanted to write
this in hex? Note how we’ve split the integer into four pieces, exactly
like ‘l’ splits it into four bytes. In fact, the four hex digits pairs
correspond exactly to the four bytes. This is no accident; it’s the main
reason computer programmers like hex so much. Just as we had the most
significant digit pair, we now have the most significant byte.
Endian-ness is all about how we arrange those bytes in the file. In
little-endian order, we write them in sequence from least significant
byte to most significant, which in this case would give us 78 56 34 12.
In big-endian order, we write them the other way around, 12 34 56 78.</p>

<p>The packer has variations for four sizes of signed integers: 8-bit (‘c’,
for “character”), 16-bit (‘s’, for “short integer”), 32-bit (‘l’, for
“long integer”), and 64-bit (‘q’, for “quad word integer”).</p>

<p>For each integer size, the packer also has an “unsigned” version.
“Unsigned” means that the value doesn’t have a plus or minus sign - it’s
always taken to be positive or zero, so you can’t store a negative value
in an unsigned integer slot. Why would you want such a limitation? It’s
because by throwing out the negative numbers, you roughly double the
highest positive value that the slot can hold. For example, a signed
short (16-bit) integer can hold values from -32,768 to +32,767, but an
unsigned short can hold values from 0 to 65,535. In a lot of cases, a
particular value simply can’t be negative because the physical quantity
it represents can’t be negative - for example, if an integer represents
the height or width of a picture, only positive values are meaningful,
since there’s no such thing as a negative width. When you know for a
fact that a value can never be negative, you can use an unsigned integer
field in order to get the extra capacity for storing higher positive
values.</p>

<p>The unsigned type codes are all simply the upper-case versions of the
signed equivalents: C, S, L, and Q.</p>

<p>Finally, the packer lets you control the byte order. Recall that the
packer always uses little-endian byte order by default. Many file
formats call for big-endian order, though, so the packer lets you
override the default. To use big-endian order for any integer type,
place a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;</code> after the type code. You can also
mark a type as explicitly little-endian by putting a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;</code> after the type code.</p>

<p>So if we wanted to change our format to store big-endian, unsigned,
16-bit values, here’s what we’d write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('S3&gt;', 1, 2, 3);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The file would now look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    00 01 00 02 00 03
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;</code> are
both suffix codes. These apply to the immediately preceding item only.
For example, if we wrote <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'lS3\&gt;'</code>, this would
write one signed little-endian long, followed by three unsigned
big-endian shorts. You can probably see how spaces would help make this
clearer: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'l S3\&gt;'</code> means exactly the same thing
but is a bit easier to read. (Then again, spaces can also make things
less clear: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'lS 3\&gt;'</code> means exactly the same
thing as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'l S3\&gt;'</code>, even though it might look
like the ‘l’ and ‘S’ are meant to be grouped. But the space doesn’t
change anything, no matter where you put it.)</p>

<p>The types c, C, s, and S all correspond to TADS integer values. Note
that these types have smaller range than the TADS integer type. If you
try to pack a value that doesn’t fit, it’ll trigger a “numeric overflow”
error. For example, this will cause an error:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('c', 1000);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The ranges for the integer types are as follows:</p>

<p>Code</p>

<p>Description</p>

<p>Range</p>

<p>c</p>

<p>Signed “char”, 8 bits</p>

<p>-128 .. 127</p>

<p>C</p>

<p>Unsigned “char”, 8 bits</p>

<p>0 .. 255</p>

<p>s</p>

<p>Signed “short”, 16 bits</p>

<p>-32,768 .. 32,767</p>

<p>S</p>

<p>Unsigned “short”, 16 bits</p>

<p>0 .. 65,535</p>

<p>l</p>

<p>Signed “long”, 32 bits</p>

<p>-2,147,483,648 .. 2,147,483,647</p>

<p>L</p>

<p>Unsigned “long”, 32 bits</p>

<p>0 .. 4,294,967,295</p>

<p>q</p>

<p>Signed “quad”, 64 bits</p>

<p>-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 .. 9,223,372,036,854,775,807</p>

<p>Q</p>

<p>Unsigned “quad”, 64 bits</p>

<p>0 ..18,446,744,073,709,551,615</p>

<p>The type ‘l’ (lower-case L, signed 32-bit long) corresponds exactly to
the TADS integer type, so you can’t trigger an overflow with it.</p>

<p>‘L’ is the unsigned 32-bit long, so it’ll cause an error if you try to
pack a negative value into this type. On the other hand, TADS integers
can’t store values as large as an ‘L’ can, so it’s impossible to
overflow this type in the positive direction with an integer value. You
can, however, store such large values in a BigNumber. When you unpack an
item with type ‘L’, by default, the value is returned as a BigNumber.
This is true even if the value would fit into a regular 32-bit integer.
The reasoning is that even if the unpacked value would fit a regular
integer, you’re asserting via the ‘L’ that you’re <em>using</em> it as an
unsigned 32-bit value, so you might perform arithmetic on the value that
would push it over the regular integer type’s limits. You can override
this by using the ~ qualifier, as in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'L~'</code>,
which tells the unpacker to return the value as regular integer if it’ll
fit, otherwise as a BigNumber.</p>

<p>The types ‘q’ and ‘Q’ are for 64-bit integers. TADS doesn’t have a
64-bit integer type per se - regular TADS integer values have to fit in
32 bits. But the BigNumber type is readily capable of storing any value
that will fit in a 64-bit integer, so in most cases you’ll use
BigNumbers as the source values when packing types q and Q. You can also
use regular integers, of course; the packer automatically “sign extends”
a regular integer value to the full 64 bits to fill out the file slot.
When unpacking q and Q items, the unpacker always returns BigNumber
values by default, even when the unpacked value would fit in an integer,
just as for type L. And as with type L, you can override this with the ~
qualifier, which unpacks a q or Q value as an integer when it’ll fit,
and as a BigNumber when it won’t.</p>

<p>The main reason for using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code>, by the way, is
that integers are quite a lot faster than BigNumber values for most
calculations, and use less memory. If you’re doing anything very
complicated with the unpacked data, or reading very large files, this
could make a difference. It’s probably not worth worrying about for
small files or simple processing.</p>

<h3 id="ignoring-overflows">Ignoring overflows</h3>

<p>If an integer value is out of bounds for the item type, as listed in the
table above, the packer throws a “numeric overflow” error by default.
You can tell the packer to ignore these errors, though. To do this, add
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> qualifier to the type. For example, to
pack a short integer without checking for overflow, you’d write
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'s%'</code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> qualifier tells the packer to “truncate”
any integer values that don’t fit in the type code’s range. This means
that the packer simply discards as many bits of the value as needed to
make it fit, at the most significant end of the value. For example, if
you pack 0x123456 with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'s%'</code>, only the
low-order 16 bits are actually packed, which means the value stored is
0x3456.</p>

<p>The reason that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> keeps only the lowest
bits of the value is that this is the behavior typical in C or Perl/php
programs in similar situations. This behavior thus provides a degree of
compatibility for programs ported from or based on code written in those
languages. It’s not exactly safe or programmer-friendly, since careless
use could lead you to create corrupted files without realizing it, but
that’s why it’s not the default.</p>

<p>The symbol <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code>, by the way, is meant to suggest
a “modulo” or remainder calculation, which is exactly what happens when
a value overflows. An overflowing value is effectively reduced modulo
the largest possible value for the type (i.e., it’s divided by the upper
bound for the type, and only the remainder is kept).</p>

<h3 id="data-conversions">Data conversions</h3>

<p>Up to now we’ve mostly taken for granted that there’s an obvious
correspondence between packed formats and TADS value types. The various
integer formats (c C s S l) translate to and from TADS integers, and the
“quad” formats (q Q) are for BigNumbers. The odd man out is the L
format, which is too big for a TADS integer half the time, so it gets
promoted to BigNumber when unpacked.</p>

<p>For unpacking purposes, that natural corrspondence is exactly what the
unpacker uses to determine the type of each returned value. (But
remember that you can also use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> qualifier
for q, Q, and L, to unpack into integers instead of BigNumbers whenever
possible.)</p>

<p>When packing, though, you get a lot more flexibility. The byte packer
will automatically convert whatever type you supply to the suitable type
for the format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For an integer type, you can supply an integer value, a BigNumber, or
a string. BigNumber values with fractional portions are rounded to the
nearest integers. Strings are parsed in decimal format, as though you
ran them through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toInteger()</code>. If a converted
value doesn’t fit within the range limits of the format code, a
numeric overflow error is triggered.</li>
  <li>For “quad word” types (q Q, and the quasi-quad type L), you can supply
an integer, BigNumber, or string. All of these are converted just as
for the shorter integer types.</li>
  <li>For a string type, you can supply a string, an integer, a BigNumber,
or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>. Integers and BigNumbers are
converted to their decimal text representations, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> is treated as an empty string.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compressed-integers">Compressed integers</h3>

<p>There’s one more integer format, which takes a rather different
approach. Type ‘k’ stores an unsigned integer of any size, using a
compressed format. You can pack an integer or BigNumber (or a string,
which will be converted to BigNumber first) to this type. ‘k’ is an
unsigned type, so the value can’t be less than zero, but there’s no hard
upper limit (there is an implementation limit that’s currently about
10<sup>500</sup>, though).</p>

<p>On unpacking, a ‘k’ item will be converted to a regular integer if it
fits, otherwise it’ll be returned as a BigNumber value.</p>

<p>The packed byte format for ‘k’ uses a variable number of bytes. The
length depends on how large the integer value is - the larger the value,
the more bytes it takes. That’s what makes it a compressed type. A type
like ‘l’ always uses the same number of bytes no matter what value is
stored, which often results in storing lots of extraneous bytes full of
zeros. ‘k’, on the other hand, only stores as many bytes as needed to
represent the actual values, which can cut down on the overall file size
if the most likely values are small numbers.</p>

<p>The format is as follows: take the binary representation of the value
and divide it into 7-bit chunks. Find the most significant chunk that
contains a non-zero bit; discard the rest. Now store the chunks in
bytes, from most significant to least significant. Set the 8th bit (the
high-order bit, 0x80) on every byte except the last (least significant).</p>

<p>The Perl documentation calls this format a “BER compressed integer” (BER
is for Binary Encoded Representation). That terminology seems to be a
source of some confusion, because “BER” is more commonly used in
reference to a standard called ASN.1, which defines BER as the
confusingly similar-sounding but completely unrelated Binary Encoding
Rules. To be clear, the ‘k’ coding doesn’t have anything to do with
ASN.1. The TADS byte packer includes this format because it reportedly
comes up from time to time in existing file formats.</p>

<h3 id="character-strings">Character strings</h3>

<p>The byte packer can store strings in fixed-sized chunks of the file, or
with varying lengths. It can translate between TADS’s internal Unicode
format and single-byte Latin-1, Unicode UTF-8 encoding, or Unicode UCS-2
encoding.</p>

<p>Here are the basic string types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a - Latin-1, pad with null bytes (“a” is for ASCII - Latin-1 is
essentially an extended version of ASCII)</li>
  <li>A - Latin-1, pad with spaces</li>
  <li>w - 16-bit Unicode (UCS-2), default little-endian byte order, pad with
null characters (“w” is for “wide character” - a C-ism for 16-bit
characters, as opposed to the plain old 8-bit “char”). Use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w\&gt;</code> for big-endian order.</li>
  <li>W - 16-bit unicode (UCS-2), pad with space characters</li>
  <li>u - Unicode UTF-8, pad with spaces (“u” is for UTF-8)</li>
  <li>U - Unicode UTF-8, pad with null bytes</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ve probably noticed the pattern: the lower-case version of a code
pads with null bytes, and the upper-case version pads with spaces.</p>

<p>You might notice that the byte packer doesn’t have codes for the full
plethora of character sets that you can use for ordinary text files - it
can only work with Latin-1 and the two Unicode formats. That shouldn’t
be a limitation in practice, since virtually all standard binary formats
that you’re likely to encounter will themselves use ASCII (which is a
subset of Latin-1), Latin-1, or Unicode. If you should find yourself
with a need for, say, Latin-2 conversions, you’ll need an extra step:
convert the string to or from a ByteArray, and use the ‘b’ code (see
“byte strings” below) to pack or unpack it.</p>

<p>If you pack a string into type ‘a’ or ‘A’, any characters outside of the
Latin-1 range are written as ‘?’. The u, U, w, and W formats can
represent every character TADS can internally.</p>

<p>If you use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> qualifier with ‘a’ or ‘A’, it
changes the behavior for characters outside the Latin-1 range. ‘a%’ or
‘A%’ treat characters outside the range as integer overflows, which are
then truncated to fit the 8-bit character type using the same scheme we
saw earlier for regular integer fields. For example, the character
U+0170 is truncated to 8 bits, yielding U+0070.</p>

<p>Some existing file formats store strings in fixed-length fields. In some
cases, this is because all possible strings for a given field are of
exactly the same length; for example, the chunk type field in a TADS .t3
file is always exactly four characters. In many cases, strings in a
fixed-length field can still vary in length, up to the fixed maximum;
when a shorter string is stored, it’s simply padded out to the full
length by adding spaces or “null” characters (zero bytes) after the end
of the string. For example, if you have a 16-byte field, you can pack a
string into it like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('a16', 'test string');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The resulting bytes in the file will look like this (hex 20 is the ASCII
code for a space character):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    t e s t 20 s t r i n g 00 00 00 00 00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you write a string that’s longer than 16 characters with ‘a16’, the
string will be truncated to 16 characters.</p>

<p>For a, A, u, and U, the length is given in <strong>bytes</strong>, as stored in the
file. For a and A, this is obvious, because one character always equals
one byte in Latin-1. For u and U, though, it can be a little
complicated, because a single character can turn into one, two, or three
bytes in UTF-8. If you write a string with ‘u16’, you can store <em>up to</em>
16 characters - but since some characters might take two or three bytes,
the actual number stored might be smaller. The byte packer will never
store an “incomplete” character - in other words, it’ll never cut off
the string between two bytes making up one character. If the packer has
to cut a ‘u’ string short, it’ll do so on a full character boundary, so
that the packed bytes always constitute a well-formed string. The reason
that u and U lengths are specified in bytes rather than characters is
that the whole notion of “fixed length” applies to the file’s bytes. “16
UTF-8 characters” isn’t a fixed byte length, whereas “16 bytes in UTF-8
format” is.</p>

<p>For w and W, the length is given in <strong>characters</strong>. The actual byte
length is twice the character length: if you write a ‘w16’ string,
you’re storing 32 bytes. Likewise, when unpacking, ‘w16’ reads 32 bytes
from the file. You can override this by adding the “!” qualifier: this
says that the count should be in bytes after all. So if you write
‘w16!’, the packer will only write 16 bytes, which will only be room for
8 characters.</p>

<p>You specify a fixed-length string using a number suffix on the string
type code. You’ll recall that with integers, a numeric suffix means
“write this many copies of the type”. With strings, it’s different: a
number after a string means “write this many charaters in the string”.</p>

<p>For varying-length strings, the most common approach is to store the
length of a string somewhere in the file before the string. That way,
when the file reader comes to the string, it knows in advance how many
bytes it has to read to fetch the string. A frequent idiom is to store
the length of the string <em>immediately</em> preceding the string’s bytes.
This is so common that the byte packer has a special syntax for it: you
first specify one of the integer codes, then you write a slash “/”,
followed by the string code. The string code in this case doesn’t need a
length suffix, since the “/” tells the packer to write the exact length
of the string. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('C/a', 'Hi!');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This first stores an 8-bit unsigned integer containing the length, then
the bytes of the string in ASCII format. Here’s how the file looks:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    03 H i !
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When unpacking, the file reader knows from the “/” to interpret the “C”
code as a length prefix, so it knows exactly how many bytes to read for
the string.</p>

<p>Note that the number stored for a “/” length prefix will always use the
same length units for the type that a count suffix would use. In other
words “C/a” and “C/u” store the length of the string in bytes, while
“C/w” stores the length in characters.</p>

<p>By the way, you can also use a string type for the length count. This
can be useful if you’re working with a file format that’s based on
human-readable text. When you use a string format for the length prefix,
the packer converts the length value to a string, in decimal format; the
unpacker converts the string back to a number to use as the length. For
example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('A3/a', 'Hello from the string packer!');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That code stores “29 “ - two digits plus a space to fill out the three
bytes of the ‘A3’ format - followed by the bytes of the string.</p>

<p>There’s one catch with using a string type as the length prefix: you can
only use a fixed-length string. ‘A3/’ is fine, but ‘A*/’ won’t work.</p>

<h3 id="null-terminated-strings">Null-terminated strings</h3>

<p>In some file formats, varying-length strings aren’t stored with a length
prefix, but have their extents marked by adding a null byte at the end
of the string. This is the way C/C++ programs represent strings in
memory, so some file formats use the same approach.</p>

<p>The special ‘0’ qualifier lets you pack and unpack null-terminated
strings. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('a0', 'Null-terminated!');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is stored in the file as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    N u l l - t e r m i n a t e d ! 00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When unpacking, the unpacker reads a character at a time from the file,
and stops when it reaches the null. The null isn’t part of the returned
string; the unpacker ends the string just before it, then skips the null
in the file so that the reader is positioned at the next value in the
file.</p>

<p>You can use null termination with a, u, w, h, and H strings. It’s not
allowed with the space-padded versions because it would be confusing to
use different characters for padding and termination. With a, u, h, and
H strings, one null byte is stored at the end of the string; with w
strings, two null bytes are stored, since every character in a w string
takes two bytes.</p>

<p>You can combine null termination with fixed-length strings. To do this,
be sure to write the length after the ‘0’, since doing it the other way
around would make the zero look like part of the length value. For
example, to write a fixed length of 16 plus null termination, use ‘a016’
(not ‘a160’, which specifies a 160-character string). When you use null
termination with a fixed-length string, the packer writes the null <em>in
addition to</em> the fixed length portion - so ‘a016’ writes 17 bytes in
total.</p>

<p>When packing, there’s no real value to combining fixed-length and null
termination. The packer simply writes the fixed-length string as normal,
then writes an extra null byte (or pair of bytes for ‘w’) after the
string. This guarantees null termination, but you could do the same
thing by adding an ‘x’ after the string (or ‘x2’ for the ‘w’ format).
When unpacking, though, there’s a useful extra feature with the
combination. The unpacker reads the fixed-length string as normal, skips
the null byte in the file, then scans the string for embedded null
characters. If it finds one, it terminates the string there. This is
useful because some third-party file writers might leave garbage in a
fixed-length string field after the first null, knowing that readers
will ignore anything past the null. (This is particularly likely with C
programs that copy memory structures directly to disk.) Without the ‘0’
qualifier, the ordinary a, u, and w types remove null padding from the
<em>end</em> of the string, but they don’t scan for earlier embedded nulls.</p>

<h3 id="byte-strings">Byte strings</h3>

<p>Sometimes you’ll want to store a string or a ByteArray’s contents as raw
bytes, rather than as text characters. There are three codes for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>b - stands for “byte string”. This code stores the characters of a
string, or the contents of a ByteArray, as unsigned 8-bit bytes.</li>
  <li>h, H - “hex string”. These codes take a string composed of hexadecimal
digits, and pack each pair of digits into binary byte in the file.
Little “h” reads the hex digits “low nibble first”, meaning that the
first digit of each pair is stored as the low-order half of the packed
byte. Capital “H” reads the hex digits in the opposite order.</li>
</ul>

<p>When packing, the “b” format is almost identical to the “a” format. It
has only one difference: if you pack a character string using the “b”
format, and it contains any character with a Unicode value outside of
the range 0-255, the packer throws an error (“numeric overflow”). This
is because you can’t store a higher number value in a single byte. The
“a” code, on the other hand, quietly stores a “?” for each such
character.</p>

<p>You can change the overflow handling of the “b” format by adding the “%”
qualifier. “b%” acts as though it were packing a series of 8-bit
integers with truncation, so any character outside of the 0-255 range is
simply truncated to 8 bits. For example, character U+0170 is written as
0x70, since only the low-order 8 bits are kept.</p>

<p>When unpacking, the b format has an important difference from “a”.
Whereas “a” returns a String value with the unpacked data, “b” returns a
ByteArray. You can unpack the same data either way; it’s just a matter
of which is more convenient for you.</p>

<p>The length for the b format (as a repeat count suffix, or as a “/”
prefix) is counted in bytes, as you’d probably expect.</p>

<p>The h and H formats give you a third way to unpack raw bytes. These
codes unpack into strings containing printable hex digits. For example,
suppose we have a file with these bytes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    H e l l o !
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s unpack it with ‘H12’. This returns the string ‘48656C6C6F21’.
The first pair of digits, ‘48’, is the hex value of the ASCII code for
‘H’. The second pair, ‘65’, is the hex code for ‘e’. And so on.</p>

<p>Note that ‘H12’ unpacks only six bytes. This is because the units for h
and H are <em>unpacked digits</em>, and each byte in the file corresponds to
two digits in the unpacked string. You can override this and change the
units to bytes using the “!” suffix. Changing the code to ‘H6!’ unpacks
six bytes, which will return a string of 12 hex digits.</p>

<h3 id="floating-point-values">Floating point values</h3>

<p>The byte packer has support for two floating point formats: ‘d’ for
“double precision” and ‘f’ for “float”. These are both represented in
the file using the IEEE 754-2008 interchange format. ‘d’ is stored using
the binary 64-bit sub-format (base 2, 11-bit exponent, 52-bit mantissa),
and ‘f’ uses the binary 32-bit sub-format (base 2, 7-bit exponent,
24-bit mantissa).</p>

<p>BigNumber values can store much larger absolute values than the ‘d’ and
‘f’ types can represent. If you pack a BigNumber value that doesn’t fit,
a numeric overflow error is thrown. You can change this by adding the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> qualifier. ‘d%’ and ‘f%’ won’t throw errors
when confronted with numbers that are too large, but instead pack
“infinity” values. “Infinity” is a special distinguished value in the
IEEE type scheme, meaning that the result of a calculation was too large
to store in the type.</p>

<p>For consistency with the integer types, the default byte order for these
types is little-endian. For a floating point value, little-endian means
that the least significant byte of the mantissa is stored first, and the
byte with the sign bit and exponent is stored last. Note that this byte
order is backwards from the IEEE standard, which calls for big-endian
order. You can force standard big-endian order using the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;</code> suffix as usual:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d\&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f\&gt;</code> store
precisely the formats defined in the standard.</p>

<p>The IEEE 754-2008 interchange format is a standard, portable format. It
also happens to be the native format (modulo endian-ness) on a number of
platforms, but that’s beside the point - it doesn’t matter to TADS
whether your platform uses this format or some other format, or doesn’t
have a native floating point type at all. TADS converts directly between
the standard IEEE 754-2008 representation and its internal BigNumber
representation, guaranteeing that the conversions are identical across
all platforms.</p>

<p>The ‘d’ and ‘f’ types are provided mostly for the sake of completeness.
Floating point numbers seem to be rare in binary file formats, probably
because (a) the IEEE standard for interchange formats is quite recent,
and before that there really wasn’t a well-defined universal format, and
(b) even if there had been a portable standard, it’s quite complex to
translate from one floating point format to another, so in all
likelihood no one would have bothered anyway. Case in point, the Perl
and php byte packers both explicitly punt on this: they simply store the
native machine formats. Now that a portable standard exists, though,
it’s possible that we’ll see floats used more readily in future binary
formats; so you could look at the inclusion of these types in TADS as a
bit of future-proofing. It also has a pragmatic use: the “native”
formats on PCs and Linux systems just happen to be byte-for-byte
identical to the IEEE formats, so those supposedly non-portable Perl and
php output files will just happen to be readable in TADS with the ‘d’
and ‘f’ formats, as long as the files were created on a PC.</p>

<p>If you’re defining your own custom file format, you can of course use
these types for storing floating point BigNumber values. Be aware that
these types have limited precision, though: the ‘d’ type can store the
equivalent of about 17 decimal digits, and ‘f’ stores a mere 7. If you
need to preserve higher precisions, you’re better off storing a
BigNumber as a string value.</p>

<h3 id="grouping">Grouping</h3>

<p>You can group a series of codes using parentheses, ( ). This lets you
apply a repeat count and a byte order suffix to a whole series of items
at once.</p>

<p>Suppose you’re working with a file format that stores pairs of names and
numbers. For each one, we’ll write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'C/a l'</code> - a
counted-length string, followed by a 32-bit integer. Now suppose we have
six of these to store. We could write it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'C/a l
C/a l C/a l C/a l C/a l C/a l'</code>. But that’s tedious; using
parentheses and a repeat count suffix, we could shorten this to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'(C/a l)6'</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the whole group is repeated on each iteration. The packer runs
through the entire contents of the group once, then starts over at the
beginning of the group for each repetition.</p>

<p>Groups can be nested: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'(l (C/a)2)3'</code> is the
same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'l C/a C/a l C/a C/a l C/a C/a'</code>.</p>

<p>One of the simplest uses of groups is to repeat a string format.
Remember that a repeat count suffix (or a “/” prefix) for a string
format specifies the number of bytes or characters in the string. If you
want to pack or unpack multiple strings, use a group. For example, to
write four Latin-1 strings with a fixed length of 15 bytes, you can
write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'(a15)4'</code>. To write six length-prefixed
Unicode strings, use ‘<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'(C/u)6'</code>.</p>

<p>Grouping is also handy if you need to apply a byte-order override to a
group of items. For example, you can simplify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'l\&gt;
s\&gt; s\&gt; S\&gt;'</code> by grouping it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'(l s s
S)\&gt;'</code>. Within a group, you can override the group byte order:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'(l\&lt; s s S)\&gt;'</code> treats all of the items as
big-endian except the first.</p>

<h3 id="list-grouping">List grouping</h3>

<p>You can also use square brackets, [ ], for grouping. Square bracket
groups work the same way as parenthesis groups for the repeat count and
endian-ness modifier. The difference is that the argument value for
packing must be a list, and the result value when unpacking is
represented as a list.</p>

<p>When packing, a square bracket group reads its contents from a list in
the arguments:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('C/a [l s]3', 'string', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[l s\]3</code> corresponds to the list
value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]</code> in the arguments.</p>

<p>You might also notice that the format code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[l
s\]3</code> specifies six items to pack, but the list argument only
contains five values. What happens with that sixth packed item? When a
value list is too short for a square-bracket group in the format list,
the packer simply packs a default value for each missing item. For
integers or floating point numbers, the default is zero; for string
types, it’s an empty string.</p>

<p>If a list argument contains too many items, on the other hand, the
packer simply ignores the extra items.</p>

<p>When unpacking, a square bracket group is unpacked as a sublist in the
result list. We can unpack the file we just packed above, like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local lst = fp.unpackBytes('C/a [l s]3');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This returns the list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\['string', \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
0\]</code>. As you can see, the unpacker create a sublist for the
grouped item. Whenever the unpacker sees a square-bracket group in the
format list, it uses a list for that group in the return value list.</p>

<p>Note that the sublist for the group contains six entries, even though
our original input list for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packBytes()</code> had
five values. Remember what we said about the default: the packer stored
a default value of zero in the file for the missing sixth slot. The
unpacker didn’t supply the default - that was actually stored in the
file when we packed it. The unpacker simply returned the zero value that
it read from the file.</p>

<h3 id="structure-grouping">Structure grouping</h3>

<p>When packing or unpacking a group, you can also tell the packer to treat
each iteration of the group as a separate sublist. This is often
convenient when packing or unpacking object structures.</p>

<p>To pack or unpack a group as a list per iteration, use the “!” with the
square-bracketed group.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit the example above, but this time unpack the group data
into sublists:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local lst = fp.unpackBytes('C/a [l s]3!');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, the return list will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\['string',
\[1, 2\], \[3, 4\], \[5, 0\]\]</code>. Rather than returning the entire
group as a single sublist with six items, the unpacker returns a
separate sublist for each iteration of the group.</p>

<p>This can be handy when you’re unpacking data into object structures,
since it lets you use list iteration functions like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mapAll()</code> to transform the unpacked data into
objects. For example, if we have a file that contains a list of
structures, each of which consists of a 32-bit integer and a 16-bit
integer, we could read the file into a custom object with something like
this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class InfoObj: object
      construct(lst)
      {
         aLong = lst[1];
         aShort = lst[2];
      }
      aLong = nil
      aShort = nil
    ;

    readInfoObjects(fp)
    {
      return fp.unpackBytes('[L S]5!').mapAll({x: new InfoObj(x)});
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This tells unpackBytes() to read five of the long/short structures from
the file, returning each one as a list with two elements. The overall
unpackBytes() result is then a list of five of these sublists. We apply
mapAll() to the list, transforming each sublist into an InfoObj instance
that we construct from the sublist data. This leaves us with a list of
five InfoObj objects. In one line, we’ve decoded this section of the
file into structured object data.</p>

<h3 id="variable-length-groups">Variable-length groups</h3>

<p>Square-bracket groups have another important ability: you can use them
with the “/” prefix count syntax. Going back to the example above,
suppose that we don’t want to use a fixed count of three for the list
group, but instead use the actual length of the list. We could do this
using the usual “/” syntax, but this time we apply it to the whole group
rather than an individual item:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('C/s C/[l s]', 'string', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you use the “/” prefix with a square-bracket group, the packer
figures out how many iterations of the group will be needed to store all
of the items in the list value, and uses that as the repeat count. It
writes out the repeat count prefix, just as when you use “/” with a
single item, then iterates through the list. So for the example above,
the bytes in the file will be:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    05 s t r i n g 03 01 00 00 00 02 00 03 00 00 00 04 00 05 00 00 00 00 00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we unpack with the same format string, the result will be
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\['string', \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0\]\]</code>, just as
when we explicitly entered the repeat count of 3.</p>

<p>You can use a string type, such as ‘A’, for the length prefix type. If
you do, the string</p>

<h3 id="auto-repeat-count">Auto repeat count</h3>

<p>Sometimes you’ll want to pack a list of values, all of the same type,
without knowing in advance how many values there are. As we’ve seen, you
can use the “/” prefix to automatically count up the elements and pack
them, but that also stores the counter prefix. When you want automatic
counting <em>without</em> storing the count, you can use the special repeat
count “*”:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('s*', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The * repeat count simply packs everything remaining in the argument
list, without storing a repeat count anywhere. When a starred item
matches up with a list value, the packer writes out everything in the
list to the starred item, then continues with the next item as normal:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('s* a15', [1, 2, 3], 'hello!');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That writes the three 16-bit integer values, followed by the string.</p>

<p>On unpacking, a * means <em>unpack the whole rest of the file</em>. For
example, to unpack an entire file into a byte array, you could simply
write</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local fp = File.openFile('test.bin', FileAccessRead);
    local b = fp.unpackBytes('b*');
    fp.closeFile();
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Be careful with * on unpacking, since it could read a lot of data if
you accidentally use it in the middle of a large file.</p>

<h3 id="up-to-repeat-counts">“Up to” repeat counts</h3>

<p>It’s sometimes useful to pack or unpack a repeated item up to some
limit, <em>or</em> to the end of the actual data being packed/unpacked,
whichever comes first. So far, we’ve seen how to pack or unpack an exact
number of items, as in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s30</code>; we’ve also seen
how to pack the whole rest of the argument list, or unpack the whole
rest of hte file, as in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s\*</code>. But what if you
want to unpack 30 items, but stop if the file runs out of data before
unpacking all 30?</p>

<p>You can do this using an “up to” count. Specify an up-to count by
combining a numeric limit and *. For example,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s30\*</code> packs or unpacks up to 30 short-integer
values, but stops if the end of the arguments (when packing) or file
(unpacking) is encountered midway through the set.</p>

<p>When packing, the limiting factor for most types is the argument list
itself (or the sublist, if packing a grouped sublist). For character
string types, the limiting factor is the length of the string. For
example, packing a 10-character string with ‘a30*’ packs all 10
characters of the string, with no padding added, while packing a
50-character string with the same ‘a30*’ packs only the first 30
characters of the string.</p>

<p>When unpacking, the limiting factor is the length of the file,
ByteArray, or string you’re unpacking from.</p>

<h3 id="padding-and-positioning">Padding and positioning</h3>

<p>There are a couple of special codes that don’t pack or unpack data
values, but rather move the read or write position in the file.</p>

<p>The code ‘x’ adds padding to the file when packing, in the form of null
bytes (bytes with the value 0). Use a count suffix with ‘x’ to write
more than one null byte: ‘x4’ writes four null bytes. ‘x’ doesn’t
consume any values from the argument list. During unpacking, ‘x’ simply
skips forward by one byte (or by multiple bytes, if there’s a suffix
count). The unpacker simply skips the bytes; it doesn’t add any values
to the result list for the skipped bytes.</p>

<p>‘x’ is often handy when working with standard file formats. Many formats
require specific byte layouts with some areas filled with null bytes for
padding, which is exactly what ‘x’ takes care of.</p>

<p>Every so often, a file format calls for a fixed byte value or string of
byte values other than zeros. There are two format codes that help with
this. First, you can enclose a string of ordinary charactres in double
quotes in the pack string, and the packer will simply write those
characters as bytes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('"hello"');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This packs the bytes h, e, l, l, o. The characters within the double
quotes are treated as byte values, so each character must be in the
Unicode value range 0-255, or an error will occur. Note that this format
code doesn’t use any argument values - it simply packs the bytes you
specify directly in the format string. By the same token, this code
won’t return any values when unpacking. In fact, this format code
doesn’t do anything when unpacking except skip the number of bytes
implied. It doesn’t even verify that the bytes in the file match the
text in the format code. In other words, unpacking
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'"hello"'</code> is exactly the same as unpacking
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'xxxxx'</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'x5'</code>}.</p>

<p>The second “literal” packing format is a string of hex digit pairs
enclosed in curly braces. Each pair of hex digits gives a byte value.
For example, we could write our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'"hello"'</code>
example above like this instead, and get the same effect:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('{68 65 6C 6C 6F}');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can, of course, use repeat counts with these formats. For example,
you could write 100 ASCII “A” bytes to a file like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    fp.packBytes('"A"100');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our next code doesn’t write anything at all - in fact, it sort of
“unwrites”. ‘X’ moves the file position backwards by one byte. With a
suffix count, it moves the file position back multiple bytes. For
example, ‘X15’ moves the file position backwards by 15 bytes. As with
‘x’, this code doesn’t consume any argument values when packing, and it
doesn’t produce any output values when unpacking.</p>

<p>You can use ‘X’ during unpacking to unpack the same bytes more than
once, with different interpretations. For example, ‘l X4 H8’ unpacks
four bytes as a 32-bit signed integer, then goes back and unpacks the
same four bytes again as a hex byte string.</p>

<p>‘x’ and ‘X’ let you specify the repeat count using the size of another
item type code. To do this, write “:<em>code</em>” as the suffix. For example,
‘x:l’ writes four null bytes, because the size of an ‘l’ code is four
bytes. If you use a character or byte string type after “:”, the
effective count is the size of a single character for that type: ‘x:a’
counts as one byte, ‘x:w’ as two bytes. ‘x:u’ and ‘x:h’ count as one
byte each.</p>

<p>’@’ lets you set a position in the file, relative to the start of the
current parenthesized or square-bracketed group. You use a number suffix
with @, but it’s not the usual repeat count. The number after @ gives a
byte offset from the start of the current group, starting at 0 for the
first byte of the group. The file is positioned to that offset before
the next byte to be packed or unpacked.</p>

<p>If you use @ outside of any group, it refers to the offset from the
start of the whole format string.</p>

<p>For example, packing ‘L @3 x’ first packs a 32-bit integer into four
bytes, then moves the file pointer to the last byte of the integer
(offset 3 means three bytes after the first byte, which is the fourth
byte written by ‘L’), then overwrites that last byte with a null byte.
So this forces the high-order 8 bits of the integer to be zero,
effectively truncating the integer to 24 bits.</p>

<p>If a group containing an @ item is repeated, the @ offset refers to the
start of the current iteration of the group. In other words, the
starting point for @ is reset for each repetition of the group.</p>

<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>

<p>The ‘x’ and ‘X’ codes have one more trick up their sleeves: they make it
easy to add “alignment” padding. In some file formats, an item might
have to be aligned on a particular boundary, meaning its byte location
has to be a multiple of some size. This is especially common for file
formats designed to be read directly into memory structures, because
this kind of alignment is a hardware requirement on many machines. The
most common alignment requirements are even alignment, meaning simply
that each item has to be at an even numbered byte offset in the file,
and size alignment, meaning that an item has to be at a byte offset
that’s a multiple of its own size (e.g., a 32-bit value would have to be
at a multiple of 4 bytes, a 64-bit value at a multiple of 8 bytes, etc).</p>

<p>To do alignment with ‘x’ and ‘X’, add the ‘!’ qualifier. For ‘x’, this
tells the packer to add enough padding to get to the next multiple of
the size. For example, ‘x2!’ makes sure the next item will be at an even
byte offset. If the current offset is already even, ‘x2!’ doesn’t do
anything; if the offset is odd, it adds a single null byte. When
unpacking, ‘x2!’ simply skips ahead to the next even byte offset.</p>

<p>‘X<em>size</em>!’ moves the file position backwards to the nearest previous
multiple of the size. As with ‘x’, if the current byte offset is already
a multiple of the size, ‘X!’ does nothing.</p>

<p>‘x!’ and ‘X!’ do nothing if you don’t specify a size. The default size
is one byte, and of course every offset is an even multiple of 1.</p>

<p>You can combine the ‘!’ and ‘:<em>type</em>’ qualifiers to align to the size of
a type. For example, ‘x:l!’ aligns to a four-byte (32-bit) boundary.</p>

<p>The offsets for ‘x’ and ‘X’ are always counted from the start of the
current format string (not from the start of the file or the start of
the group).</p>
