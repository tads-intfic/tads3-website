<h1 id="tads-io-function-set">tads-io Function Set</h1>

<p>The tads-io function set provides access to the user interface provided
by the TADS 3 Interpreter host applications, as well as file
input/output functions. The tads-io function set is available only in T3
implementations that are hosted within a TADS 3 Interpreter environment,
so a program that uses this function set will only run in a TADS
Interpreter.</p>

<p>The tads-io function set is separate from the tads-gen function set to
allow programmers to choose an alternative input/output and user
interface function set, if desired, while still using the more general
tads-gen functions. Most programs will probably want to use the tads-gen
set because of the many data conversion and manipulation functions it
contains, even if they’re using an alternative user interface.</p>

<p>To use this set of functions in your program,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\#include \&lt;tadsio.h\&gt;</code>, or simply
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\#include \&lt;tads.h\&gt;</code> (which includes both
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;tadsio.h\&gt;</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;tadsgen.h\&gt;</code>, for the full set of TADS
intrinsics). If you’re using the adv3 library, you can simply
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\#include \&lt;adv3.h\&gt;</code>, since that automatically
includes the basic system headers.</p>

<h2 id="banner-api">Banner API</h2>

<p>The tads-io function set incorporates a set of functions known as the
Banner API. These functions let you divide the interpreter’s application
window into several independent subwindows. The adv3 library uses this
to implement a number of special UI effects, including the standard
adventure game “status line” feature.</p>

<p>Using the Banner API requires some knowledge of the underlying display
model, which is described in detail in the <a href="banners.html">Banner Model</a>
section.</p>

<h2 id="tads-io-functions">tads-io functions</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerClear(*handle*)</code></p>

<p>Clears the banner’s display. Removes all text from the banner, and moves
the output position back to the upper left corner of the banner’s
window.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerCreate(*parent*, *where*, *other*,
*windowType*, *align*, *size*, *sizeUnits*, *style*)</code></p>

<p>Creates a new banner window with the given parameters.</p>

<p><em>parent</em> is the handle of an existing banner that is to serve as the
parent of the new banner, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> if the new
banner is to be a child of the main game window. The new banner’s space
is obtained by splitting the parent window.</p>

<p><em>where</em> and <em>other</em> together indicate where the banner goes in the
parent’s list of children, which determines how the new banner is laid
out relative to the other children of the same parent (see the screen
Layout overview above). <em>where</em> can be one of the following values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerFirst</code> - indicates that the new banner
is the first child of <em>parent</em>. <em>other</em> is not used in this case.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerLast</code> - indicates that the new banner
is the last child of <em>parent</em>. <em>other</em> is not used.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerBefore</code> - indicates that the new banner
should be inserted into the child list immediately before <em>other</em>,
which must be the handle of an existing child of <em>parent</em>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAfter</code> - indicates that the new banner
should be inserted into the child list immediately after <em>other</em>,
which must be the handle of an existing child of <em>parent</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the child list order specified via where and other is not
permanent; it merely determines where the new banner goes in the current
child list of the given parent. For example, specifying
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerFirst</code> does not mean that the banner will
remain the first child forever; it merely puts it at the start of the
current list. If banner A is created with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerFirst</code> specified, and later banner B is
created with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerFirst</code>, banner A will become
the second child after B.</p>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerBefore</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAfter</code> is specified, and <em>other</em> is not a
valid banner handle or is not a child of the given parent, then the
system ignores <em>where</em> and <em>other</em> and inserts the banner as the last
child of the parent, as though <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerLast</code> had
been specified.</p>

<p>The <em>windowType</em> parameter indicates the type of banner to create; this
is one of the following (see “Banner Types” above for more information):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerTypeText</code> - an ordinary text window.
This type of window behaves essentially the same way as the main game
window; in particular, it interprets HTML to the same extent that the
main game window does.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerTypeTextGrid</code> - a “text grid” window,
which simulates a character-mode terminal window by displaying a
rectangular array of characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>align</em> value indicates how the banner’s space is carved out of its
parent’s space. This can have one of the following values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAlignTop</code> - the banner goes at the top
of the parent’s space</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAlignBottom</code> - the banner goes at the
bottom of the parent’s space</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAlignLeft</code> - the banner goes at the
left of the parent’s space</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAlignRight</code> - the banner goes at the
right of the parent’s space</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>size</em> parameter gives the initial size of the banner, the meaning
of which depends on <em>sizeUnits</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerSizePercent</code> - the size is a percentage
of the parent’s space as it is just before carving out this banner.
<em>size</em> is a value from 0 to 100. The banner will remember that its
size is a percentage; whenever the overall display area size changes
(for example, whenever the user resizes the main application window
for the interpreter), the size of the banner on-screen will be
refigured as the same percentage of the new available space.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerSizeAbsolute</code> - the size is given in
the “natural units” of the banner, which depend upon the window type:
    <ul>
      <li>For a text window (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerTypeText</code>), the
size is given in character rows or columns. The size of each
character can vary if the window uses a proportional font or can
display multiple fonts, so for consistency we define this unit as
the size of a “0” character in the window’s default (initial) font.
To compute the actual pixel size of the window, the system will take
into account space needed for interior margins and borders; this
ensures that the window will be large enough to show the requested
number of rows or columns of text. (Note, however, that a banner of
size 0 will not add any internal space, since a zero-sized banner
has no screen presence at all.)</li>
      <li>For a text grid window
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerTypeTextGrid</code>), the size is given in
rows or columns in the grid’s fixed-pitch font. As with a text
window, the space needed for margins and borders will be added to
the requested row/column size.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>style</em> is a combination of flag values specifying the desired behavior
for the banner. Some of the style flags directly indicate particular
aspects of the on-screen appearance of the banner; other styles are
advisory, giving the interpreter some hints about how you’re planning to
use the banner, so that the interpreter can select appearance or
behavior variations that are appropriate to the current platform. Not
all interpreters support all styles, so you have to think of the style
flags as hints to the interpreter about the desired appearance, rather
than a specification of the actual appearance. After you create the
banner, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerGetInfo()</code> to
retrieve the actual style flags, which will give you some indication of
how the interpreter treated your request.</p>

<p>The style flags are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleBorder</code> - show the banner with a
border, which is to say a line on the banner’s inner edge (the edge
nearest the main text window: for a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAlignTop</code> banner, this will be the
banner’s bottom edge). Most character-mode interpreters do not support
this style, because drawing a border would consume an entire character
row or column and would thus take up too much space visually.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleVScroll</code> - show the banner with a
vertical scrollbar, if the system has scrollbars. Character-mode
platforms will usually ignore this flag.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleHScroll</code> - show the banner with a
horizontal scrollbar, if possible.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleAutoVScroll</code> - whenever new text
is displayed in the banner, and the new text would appear outside of
the on-screen boundaries of the banner, scroll the banner’s contents
vertically to bring the latest text into view. If this style isn’t
set, the banner won’t automatically scroll vertically (if it has a
vertical scrollbar, though, the user will be able to scroll it
manually).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleAutoHScroll</code> - when new text is
displayed in the banner, scroll the banner’s contents horizontally if
necessary to bring the new text into view.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleTabAlign</code> - the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;TAB\&gt;</code> tag is needed for text alignment
purposes in the new window. This flag won’t change the appearance of
the banner in a full HTML interpreter or in most character-mode
interpreters, but for text-only interpreters running on GUI systems
where proportional fonts are available, this might force the
interpreter to use a fixed-pitch font for the banner so that it can
use spaces to implement the tab alignment.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleMoreMode</code> - use “more” mode in the
banner. This implies the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleAutoVScroll</code> style. In “more”
mode, the interpreter pauses whenever new text written to the banner
is about to force older text to scroll out of view, to ensure that the
user has had a chance to read all of the text before it scrolls away.
The exact user interface varies by platform; on most systems, the
interpreter displays a prompt message, such as “[More]”, in the
window that’s about to overflow, then waits for the user to press a
key. This style allows a banner window to be used to display long
passages without worrying about whether or not the text will fit in
the user’s available display area.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleHStrut</code> - makes the banner a
“horizontal strut” when
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSizeToContents()</code> is used to set the
parent banner’s width. If the child banner is a vertical banner (i.e.,
it has left or right alignment), the width of the child’s contents is
added to the width of the parent’s contents to determine the overall
content width. If the child banner is a horizontal banner (top or
bottom alignment), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSizeToContents()</code>
will set the parent’s width to the larger of the widths of the
parent’s or child’s contents.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleVStrut</code> - makes the banner a
“vertical strut” when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSizeToContents()</code>
is used to set the parent banner’s width. This has the same effect on
height that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleHStrut</code> has on width.</li>
</ul>

<p>This function returns a handle to the new banner, or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> if an error occurs creating the banner.
The banner handle can be used to operate on the banner in other
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerXxx()</code> functions.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerDelete(*handle*)</code></p>

<p>Delete the given banner. This removes the banner from the display, and
recalculates the layout for all of the other banners remaining on the
screen. After this function is called, the banner handle becomes invalid
and must not be used for anything else.</p>

<p>Note that any children of the banner being deleted will immediately
become invisible. They will remain valid, so you can continue to pass
their handles to banner functions, but they will not have any display
presence. A banner always obtains its display space by splitting its
parent, so once the parent is gone, a child has no way of obtaining any
screen space of its own and thus becomes invisible.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerFlush(*handle*)</code></p>

<p>Flushes the text output buffer for the given banner, immediately
updating the display with any pending text.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerGetInfo(*banner*)</code></p>

<p>Retrieves information on the banner. This function returns a list of
values, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[1] - the window’s alignment type (a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAlignXxx</code> value)</li>
  <li>[2] - the window’s actual style (a bit-wise combination of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerStyleXxx</code> flags). This can be used to
determine how the styles originally requested were interpreted by the
local platform. In some cases, it might be desirable to take some
special action if a given style flag wasn’t honored; for example, if a
border was requested but the actual style flags indicate that no
border is displayed, the program might want to use a different
background color in the banner to make the banner’s screen area stand
out from the adjacent window’s.</li>
  <li>[3] - the height of the banner’s screen area, in text rows. For GUI
platforms, this is an estimate only, since the size of text can vary
on these platforms; the estimate will give the number of lines of text
in the window’s default font that will fit in the window’s height,
which might be considerably different than the number of lines
actually displayed.</li>
  <li>[4] - the width of the banner’s screen area, in text columns. As
with the height, this is only an estimate on GUI platforms, since the
banner might use proportionally-spaced characters and might use
several different fonts; the estimate gives the number of digit 0’s,
in the window’s default font, that will fit in the window’s width.</li>
  <li>[5] - the pixel height of the banner. This is meaningful only on GUI
platforms; on character-mode platforms, this will always be zero.</li>
  <li>[6] - the pixel width of the banner. This is used on GUI platforms
only; on character-mode platforms, this will always be zero.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerGoTo(*handle*, *row*, *col*)</code></p>

<p>Move the output position in the given text grid banner to the given row
and column. Rows and columns are numbered from 1 at the upper left
corner. This function can be used only in text grid windows; in other
types of windows, it has no effect.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSay(*handle*, ...)</code></p>

<p>Writes one or more text items to the banner. This function treats the
parameters following <em>handle</em> the same way that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tadsSay()</code> does.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSetScreenColor(*handle*, *color*)</code></p>

<p>Set the background color in the banner. This immediately changes the
entire window’s background to the given color (in other words, this
doesn’t merely affect subsequent text, but also affects everything
already displayed in the banner). The color values are the same as for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSetTextColor()</code>, except that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorTransparent</code> is not meaningful here. This
function can’t be used in ordinary text windows
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerTypeText</code>); use the HTML
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;BODY BGCOLOR\&gt;</code> tag instead.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSetSize(*handle*, *size*, *sizeUnits*,
*isAdvisory*)</code></p>

<p>Set the size of the banner. The <em>size</em> and <em>sizeUnits</em> parameters have
the same meanings they do in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerCreate()</code>.
If <em>isAdvisory</em> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>, it indicates that the
size setting is only an estimate, and that a call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSizeToContents()</code> will be made later; in
this case, the interpreter might simply ignore this estimated size
setting entirely, to avoid unnecessary redrawing. Platforms that do not
support contents-based sizing will always set the estimated size, even
when isAdvisory is true. If <em>isAdvisory</em> is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, the platform will set the banner size as
requested; set <em>isAdvisory</em> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> when you
will not follow up with a call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSizeToContents()</code>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSetTextColor(*handle*, *fg*, *bg*)</code></p>

<p>Set the text color in the given banner to the given foreground (<em>fg</em>)
and background (<em>bg</em>) colors. The new color settings are used for text
subsequently displayed; any text already displayed is not affected. This
can’t be used in ordinary text windows
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerTypeText</code>); use the HTML
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;FONT COLOR\&gt;</code> tag instead.</p>

<p><em>fg</em> and <em>bg</em> can have the following values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorText</code> - the default text foreground
color (usually a user preference setting)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorTextBg</code> - the default text background
color</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorStatusText</code> - the default “status line”
text color</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorStatusBg</code> - the default status line
background color</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorInput</code> - the default input text color</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorRGB(*r*, *g*, *b*)</code>} - the specific
color given as with red, green, and blue component values; each
component can vary from 0 to 255.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorRGB(0,0,0)</code> is black,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and ColorRGB(255,255,255)</code> is white.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorBlack</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorWhite</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorRed</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorBlue</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorGreen</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorYellow</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorCyan</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorAqua</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorMagenta</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorSilver</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorGray</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorMaroon</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorPurple</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorFuchsia</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorLime</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorOlive</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorNavy</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorTeal</code> provide the standard set of
HTML-defined colors. These are all convenience macros that simply use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorRGB()</code> with the corresponding HTML RGB
values.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the special value
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ColorTransparent</code> can be used for the
background color. This indicates that the text should be drawn with a
transparent background, and thus should simply be drawn against the
banner’s current background color.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSizeToContents(*handle*)</code></p>

<p>Resizes the given banner based on the current contents of the banner.
For a top-aligned or bottom-aligned banner, this sets the banner’s
height so that the banner is just tall enough to show all of the
contents as currently laid out. For a left-aligned or right-aligned
banner, this sets the banner’s width so that the banner is just wide
enough to hold the banner’s single widest indivisible element (such as a
single word or a picture). This routine can be used to set the banner’s
size based on the actual size of the contents; it’s impossible to know
the exact size of a banner’s contents until you actually display the
contents, because the sizes of fonts and other display elements vary
from one machine to another, and can even change on the same machine in
response to user preference settings and other factors.</p>

<p>Note that this routine might not be implemented on all platforms; on
platforms where it’s not implemented, it’s legal to call this routine,
but the function will have no effect. To ensure that a reasonable size
is always set regardless of platform, callers should always use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSetSize()</code> to set an approximate size,
passing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> for the <em>isAdvisory</em> flag, and
then call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSizeToContents()</code> to set the
exact content-based size. On platforms where
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSizeToContents()</code> is supported, this will
set the exact content-based size; on other platforms, this will at least
set the size to a suitable approximation.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clearScreen()</code></p>

<p>Clear the main console window, if possible. The actual effect of this
function varies by system; some interpreters clear the window, some
display enough newlines to scroll any existing text off the top of the
window, and some ignore the call completely.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flushOutput()</code></p>

<p>Immediately flushes text to the output. When you display output using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tadsSay()</code>, the text you write isn’t
necessarily displayed immediately, because the output formatter
generally buffers text internally; the exact details of the output
formatter’s internal buffering vary by platform. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flushOutput()</code> function tells the output
formatter to display any buffered text immediately. It is never
necessary to call this function, because the formatter automatically
flushes its buffers before waiting for user input. It is, however,
sometimes desirable to be able to display buffered output explicitly;
for example, if your program is going to perform some computation that
will take a while, you might want to ensure that the user sees a “please
wait” message before the long-running computation begins.</p>

<p>This function takes no arguments and returns no value.</p>

<p><span id="getLocalCharSet"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getLocalCharSet(*which*)</code></p>

<p>Returns a string giving the name of the active local character set
selected by <em>which</em>, which can have one of the following values:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CharsetDisplay</code> - returns the name of the
character set displayed on the monitor and read from the keyboard. If
the interpreter was started with an explicit character set option (the
“-cs” option in the command-line interpreter, for example), the
character set name so specified is returned; otherwise, the local
default display character set name is returned.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CharsetFileName</code> - returns the name of the
character set used in the file system for filenames. In some cases,
this might differ from the display character set; for example, a
system might have a global file system character set used by all
applications, but allow individual terminal or window sessions to use
separate character sets for the user interface.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CharsetFileCont</code> - returns the name of the
character set typically used for the contents of text files on the
local system. Note that this is only a default; a particular file
could be in any character set, determined at the time the file was
created. However, on most systems, there’s a character set that’s used
by convention for most text files.</li>
</ul>

<p>If <em>which</em> is not one of the above values, the function returns
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>.</p>

<p>The character set name returned can be used to create a
<a href="charset.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CharacterSet</code></a> object to perform
character-to-byte and byte-to-character mappings.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputDialog(*icon*, *prompt*, *buttons*,
*defaultButton*, *cancelButton*)</code></p>

<p>Displays an “alert box” dialog (also known as a “message box”), and
waits for the user to respond. This displays a dialog that includes a
short message for the user to read, an icon indicating the general
nature of the condition that gave rise to the dialog (an error, a
warning, a choice for the user to make, etc.), and a set of push-buttons
that dismiss the dialog and (in some cases) let the user choose among
options.</p>

<p>On GUI systems, this will use a standard system dialog if the OS
provides. On character-mode systems, this will generally not display a
GUI-style dialog, but will simply display the prompt string and let the
user type a response.</p>

<p><em>icon</em> gives the type of icon to show in the dialog, if any; <em>prompt</em> is
the message string to display; <em>buttons</em> gives the set of buttons to
display; <em>defaultButton</em> is the index (starting at 1) among the buttons
of the default button; and <em>cancelButton</em> is the index of the
cancellation button.</p>

<p>The <em>icon</em> value can be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgIconNone</code> - no icon</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgIconWarning</code> - “warning” icon; indicates
a possible problem but not a serious error</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgIconInfo</code> - “information” icon;
indicates that the message is for information only, and doesn’t
indicate an error or warning</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgIconQuestion</code> - “question” icon;
indicates that the program is requesting information from the user</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgIconError</code> - “error” icon; indicates
that an error has occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>buttons</em> value can be one of the constants listed below, to select
a standard set of buttons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgOk</code> - show only an “OK” button</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgOkCancel</code> - show “OK” and “Cancel”
buttons</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgYesNo</code> - show “Yes” and “No” buttons</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgYesNoCancel</code> - show “Yes”, “No”, and
“Cancel” buttons</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, <em>buttons</em> can be a list (or a <a href="opoverload.html#listlike">list-like
object</a>) specifying a custom set of buttons.
Each element of the list is either a string giving a custom label for
the button, or one of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgLblXxx</code> values
listed below to select a standard label. The standard labels should be
used when possible, as these will be automatically localized; labels
given explicitly as strings will be used exactly as given. If a list of
custom button labels is given, the buttons are displayed in the dialog
in the order of the list (usually left to right, but this could vary
according to system conventions and localization).</p>

<p>Each custom button label string can incorporate an ampersand
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>). The letter immediately following the
ampersand, if provided, is used as the keyboard shortcut for the button.
This is particularly important on character-mode systems, where the
“dialog” is typically shown merely as a text prompt, and the user
responds by selecting the letter of the desired option. Typically, you
should use the first character of a button label as its keyboard
shortcut, but this obviously won’t work when two button labels have the
same first letter; in these cases, you should choose another letter from
the button label, preferably something like the first letter of the
second word of the button label, or the first letter of the stressed
syllable of the most important word of the label.</p>

<p>The button label constants are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgLblOk</code> - “OK” button</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgLblCancel</code> - “Cancel”</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgLblYes</code> - “Yes”</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InDlgLblNo</code> - “No”</li>
</ul>

<p>The return value is the index among the buttons of the button that the
user selects to dismiss the dialog. The function doesn’t return until
the user selects one of the buttons.</p>

<p>If an error occurs, the return value is 0. In most cases, this means
that the user has closed the game window or disconnected the terminal
session. It can also indicate a resource error, such as the system being
too low on memory to display the dialog, although this is rare on modern
systems. (There’s no way to distinguish end-of-file and resource errors,
but that’s not too important because in either case the best course of
action for the game is simply to exit.)</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent(*timeout*?)</code></p>

<p>Wait for an event, with the optional <em>timeout</em>, given in milliseconds.
If the <em>timeout</em> value is omitted or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>,
there is no timeout, so the function waits indefinitely for an event.</p>

<p>The function returns when either an event occurs or the timeout expires.
The return value is a list containing one or more elements. The first
element of the list is a constant that indicates the type of event that
occurred; the remaining elements of the list vary according to the event
type. The event type codes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtKey</code> - the user pressed a key. The
second element of the list is a string giving the key pressed. The
string returns varies according to the type of key.</p>

    <p>For a regular character key, this is simply the character. For
example, if the user presses the A key with no Shift key or Caps Lock
in effect, the returned string is simply
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'a'</code>. If the user holds down the Shift key
and presses B, the returned string is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'B'</code>.</p>

    <p>For the standard non-printing keys, the corresponding ASCII control
character is returned: for the Tab key,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'\t'</code>; for the Return or Enter key,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'\n'</code>. Note that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'\n'</code> is returned for Return or Enter
<em>regardless</em> of the local system’s newline conventions, so you don’t
have to worry about the different conventions used on different
systems.</p>

    <p>For “special” keys - cursor arrows, “F” keys, and the like - the
returned string is a portable name for the key. The special key names
are assigned by TADS, so they’re the same on every system - you don’t
have to worry about the hardware or OS-specific representations of
these keys, because TADS maps the local representation into these
universal key names. Special key names are always enclosed in square
brackets, so you can easily distinguish them from ordinary character
keys. The key names are:</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[alt-a\]</code></p>

    <p>Alt-A (i.e., the “Alt” key plus the letter A); likewise for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[alt-b\]</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[alt-1\]</code>, etc.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[ctrl-a\]</code></p>

    <p>Ctrl-A (i.e., the “Ctrl” or “Control” key plus the letter A); likewise
for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[ctrl-b\]</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[ctrl-c\]</code>, etc.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[esc\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Escape” or “Esc” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[up\]</code></p>

    <p>the “up” cursor arrow</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[down\]</code></p>

    <p>the “down” cursor arrow</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[right\]</code></p>

    <p>the “right” cursor arrow</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[left\]</code></p>

    <p>the “left” cursor arrow</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[home\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Home” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[end\]</code></p>

    <p>the “End” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[del-word\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Delete Word” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[del-eol\]</code></p>

    <p>the “delete to end of line” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[del-line\]</code></p>

    <p>the “delete line” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[insert\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Insert” or “Ins” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[del\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Delete” or “Del” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[scroll\]</code></p>

    <p>the “scroll lock” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[page up\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Page Up” or “Previous Page” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[page down\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Page Down” or “Next Page” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[top\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Top of Document” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[bottom\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Bottom of Document”</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[f1\]</code></p>

    <p>function key F1; likewise for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[f2\]</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[f3\]</code>, etc.</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[bksp\]</code></p>

    <p>the Backspace key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[word-left\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Word Left” or “Previous Word” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[word-right\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Word Right” or “Next Word” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[eof\]</code></p>

    <p>the “End of File” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[break\]</code></p>

    <p>the “Break” key</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[?\]</code></p>

    <p>any other key</p>

    <p>Note that you can’t count on any of the special keys to be available
on every machine. Some keyboards simply have no equivalents for some
of these keys. Furthermore, even on systems that do have all of these
keys, some of them might have special meanings, due to hardware, the
operating system, or other software; so a keystroke might be
intercepted before it ever reaches
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code>. For example, certain
Ctrl+Letter keys and F-keys have special meanings in the Windows HTML
TADS interpreter because they’re assigned as menu command keys (also
known as “accelerators” or “shortcuts”); Windows intercepts these keys
and activates their special meanings before
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code> has a chance to read them, so
they’ll never generate events that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code> can read.</p>

    <p>Because you can’t count on any given special key to be available to
every user, you should avoid hard-wiring these keys into your program.
For maximum portability, you should either (a) give users a way of
customizing the keyboard layout, so that they can select the special
keys that work properly on their keyboards, or (b) provide ordinary
letter or number key equivalents for any special keys you use. The
menu system module (menusys.t) in the Adv3 library uses the latter
approach: it lets the user use the cursor arrow keys to navigate menu
screens, but also assigns alphabetic equivalents: “U” for up, “D” for
down, “P” for previous menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtTimeout</code> - the timeout expired</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtHref</code> - the user clicked on a hyperlink
(i.e., text or graphics displayed in a window with an HTML
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;A HREF=xxx\&gt;\&gt;</code> tag). The second element of
the list is a string giving the text of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HREF</code> attribute of the hyperlink that was
clicked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtNoTimeout</code> - this isn’t an event, but
rather an error code: it indicates that the platform doesn’t support
the timeout feature of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code>. When
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code> is called with a timeout value
on a platform that doesn’t support the timeout feature, the function
simply returns this result code immediately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtEof</code> - an “end of file” error has
occurred. This indicates that the program is in the process of
terminating. This happens, for example, when the user explicitly
terminates the interpreter program (by closing its main window in the
GUI, for example), or when the OS is terminating programs in
preparation for shutting down the computer. This event type indicates
that no further input will be available.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that new events could be added in the future, so be aware that your
code might receive events that aren’t on this list. It should always be
safe to simply ignore an event you don’t recognize or don’t want to
process; the purpose of events is to notify the program that something
has happened, so the interpreter should always be able to carry on with
its own processing whether or not your code does anything in response to
a particular event.</p>

<p><span id="inputFile"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputFile(*prompt*, *dialogType*, *fileType*,
*flags*)</code></p>

<p>Display a file selector dialog and wait for the user to respond. On GUI
systems, this displays a standard system file selector dialog; on
text-only platforms, this generally just displays the prompt text and
waits for the user to type a filename.</p>

<p><em>prompt</em> is the message string to display in the dialog, to let the user
know the purpose of the file selection. On many GUI systems, the
physical display area allotted for this message is fairly small, so it’s
best to keep it short: “Saved game file” or “Log file,” for instance.
There’s usually not any need for a long, detailed message anyway, since
in most cases the user will already know what the dialog is for simply
because they just initiated the action that triggered the dialog. For
example, if the user types SAVE, they’ll expect to be asked for a name
for the saved game.</p>

<p><em>dialogType</em> is one of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InFileXxx</code> constants
below, specifying whether the request is to select an existing file or
to specify the name for a new file. <em>fileType</em> is one of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileTypeXxx</code> constants below, giving the format
of the file being requested; this is used on some systems to filter the
displayed list of existing files so that only files of the same format
are included, to reduce clutter.</p>

<p><em>flags</em> is reserved for future use and should be set to zero.</p>

<p>The constants for <em>dialogType</em> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InFileOpen</code> - “open” dialog: selects an
existing file</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InFileSave</code> - “save” dialog: selects a name
for a file to be created</li>
</ul>

<p>The constants for <em>fileType</em> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileTypeLog</code> - log (transcript) file</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileTypeData</code> - TADS 2 private binary data
format</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileTypeCmd</code> - command input file</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileTypeText</code> - text</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileTypeBin</code> - unknown binary data</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileTypeUnknown</code> - unknown type</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileTypeT3Image</code> - TADS 3 image file (i.e., a
compiled TADS 3 program, a .t3 file)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileTypeT3Save</code> - TADS 3 saved state file</li>
</ul>

<p>The return value is a list. The first element is an integer giving the
status, and additional elements vary according to the status code. The
status codes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InFileSuccess</code> indicates that the user
successfully selected a file. The following additional elements are in
the returned list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>[2] = the selected file name, as a <a href="filename.html">FileName</a> object</li>
      <li>[3] = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> (reserved for future use)</li>
      <li>[4] = warning message string, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The warning message string in element [4] is non-nil only if the
file selection was read from a script, <em>and</em> the script reader
detected a possible error condition for the file name, <em>and</em> the
script reader didn’t display the warning itself. The script reader
checks the selection from an Open dialog to make sure the file exists,
and checks the selection from a Save dialog to make sure the file
<em>doesn’t</em> already exist (to protect against accidentally overwriting
an existing file) and that it’s possible to create and write to the
file. If any of these tests fail for scripted input, the script reader
generates a suitable warning message. In the conventional console UI,
the script reader automatically displays these warning messages
itself, so games built for the traditional UI don’t have to concern
themselves with this. However, in the Web UI, it’s not possible for
the script reader to display these warnings itself, since the script
reader doesn’t have access to the Web UI communications channels.
Instead, it returns the warning text to the caller via this return
list element. The caller is responsible for displaying the warning to
the user in this case.</p>

    <p>To allow for localization, the error message starts with a two-letter
error code, followed by a space, followed by the English text of the
message. Localized libraries can replace the message text based on the
two-letter error code:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>OV - the script might overwrite an existing file (Save dialog)</li>
      <li>WR - the file can’t be created/written (Save dialog)</li>
      <li>RD - the file doesn’t exist (Open dialog)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InFileFailure</code> indicates a system error of
some kind showing the dialog. There are no additional return list
elements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InFileCancel</code> indicates that the user
explicitly canceled the dialog (such as by clicking a “Cancel” button
in the UI). There are no additional return list elements.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Files selected with inputFile() are granted special permissions that
bypass the <a href="terp.html#file-safety">file safety</a> settings. The program is
allowed to read a file selected with an Open dialog, and is allowed to
write a file selected with a Save dialog, even if the file safety
settings would normally prohibit access to the same file. The special
extra permissions are granted because of the direct interaction with the
user; the user is asked to select a file to read or write, so the act of
selecting the file expresses an intention to allow that operation. (The
visual presentation of the dialog is under system control, so the game
program can’t deceive the user about the basic read or write operation
being proposed. It could use the prompt message to lie about the purpose
of the file access, but it can’t lie about the basic nature of the
access.) The special permission is stored as an internal attribute of
the <a href="filename.html">FileName</a> object returned by inputFile() function, so
you have to use the actual FileName object returned to exercise the
special permission. For example, converting the FileName to a string and
then attempting to open the file via the string will revert to the
ordinary file safety rules for the file.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputKey()</code></p>

<p>Read a keystroke from the user. Waits for the user to press a key, then
returns a string with the key the user pressed.</p>

<p>This function returns a string indicating which key the user pressed.
The key strings have the same meaning as for an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtKey</code> event from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputEvent()</code>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLine()</code></p>

<p>Read a line of text input from the user. Returns the text of the input
as a string. (The returned string will <strong>not</strong> contain a newline
character.) Returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> if an “end of file”
error occurs, which usually indicates that the user has closed the
interpreter application.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel(*reset*)</code></p>

<p>Cancels an editing session interrupted by a timeout. This function must
be called after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> returns the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtTimeout</code> event code if any display input
or output is to be performed before the next call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code>. This function terminates
the editing session, making any changes to the visual display that would
have occurred if the user had terminated the command entry by pressing
the Return key or some equivalent action. For example, this function
changes the display by starting a new line of text after the line that
was being edited.</p>

<p>The <em>reset</em> argument indicates whether or not
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> should forget the editing
state that was in effect when the timeout occurred. If <em>reset</em> is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>, then the next call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> will start with a blank
input line; if reset is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, then the next
call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> will re-display the
line of text that was under construction when the timeout occurred, and
will restore the editing state (cursor position, selected text range,
and so on) that was in effect.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout(*timeout*?)</code></p>

<p>Read a line of text input from the user, with an optional <em>timeout</em>
given in milliseconds. See the section on real-time input
<a href="#rtinput">below</a> for examples of how to use this function. If <em>timeout</em>
is missing or is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, there is no time limit
on the input.</p>

<p>This function might not be implemented on every platform, because some
platforms do not have the necessary operating system features to support
it. If a platform does not support the timeout feature, this function
will return an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtNoTimeout</code> pseud-event
immediately upon invocation if <em>timeout</em> is given as a
non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> value.</p>

<p>The return value is a list, the first element of which gives an event
code. Additional elements vary according to the event type. The event
codes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtEof</code> - end of file reading the input.
This indicates that the application is being terminated or that an
error occurred reading the keyboard. The result list has no additional
elements.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtLine</code> - a line of input was successfully
read from the keyboard. This event is returned when the user expressly
enters the line of text by pressing the Return key or performing some
other action that terminates the editing, such as clicking on a
hyperlink or selecting a command from a menu. When this event code is
returned, the second element of the result list contains a string
giving the text entered.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtTimeout</code> - the timeout interval expired
before the user finished editing the line of text. The second element
of the result list is a string giving the line of text under
construction.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtNoTimeout</code> - indicates that the timeout
feature is not supported on the local system. The timeout feature is
not universally supported. The caller will have to use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLine()</code> in this case; real-time input
interruptions will not be available.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtEndQuietScript</code> - indicates that the
input reader had been returning text from a “quiet” input script file,
such as a script being read using the “-i” option of the command-line
interpreter. When a script is read in “quiet” mode, the interpreter
suppresses all text display while the script is being processed, so no
input or output is displayed on the console. The interpreter returns a
specific event for this case because any prompting text previously
displayed for this input line will not have been shown, since the
quiet mode will have suppressed the prompt text along with any other
output; this event allows the caller to re-display the prompt now that
script input has ended and regular keyboard input will be resumed, so
that the user will see a command-line prompt and thus know that the
interpreter is waiting for new input.</li>
</ul>

<p>When this function returns the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InEvtTimeout</code>
event code, the caller must not perform any display input or output
operations in the same window until after calling
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel()</code>, with the single exception
that the caller can call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code>
again with no intervening call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel()</code>.</p>

<p>After a timeout occurs, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code>
is called again with no intervening call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel()</code>, then
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> resumes editing the
interrupted command line. In this case, there is no visible effect of
the timeout; from the user’s perspective, the timeout never occurred.
This allows the program to carry out background operations silently
while the user edits a command line.</p>

<p>If a timeout occurs and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel(nil)</code>
is subsequently called, then
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> is called again, the new
call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> re-displays the
command line as it was at the time of interruption, and then allows the
user to resume editing where they left off. In this case, there is a
visible change to the display, in that the command line is re-displayed;
however, all of the editing state (cursor position, selected text range,
history recall position, and so on) is duplicated from the previous
editing session. So, although the user will see that editing was
interrupted, the user can continue editing the command line exactly
where they left off.</p>

<p>When this function is called without the <em>timeout</em> argument, or with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> as the timeout value, it is similar to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLine()</code>, in that it allows the user to
edit a line of text, with no upper limit on how long to wait until the
user finishes. However, this function differs from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLine()</code> in one important respect: if the
preceding call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> ended
with the timeout expiring, and no intervening call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel(true)</code> was made since the
timeout occurred, this function will resume editing of the interrupted
command line.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logConsoleClose(*handle*)</code></p>

<p>Closes the given console. This function closes the operating system
file, so no further text can be written to the console after this
function is called.</p>

<p><span id="logConsoleCreate"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logConsoleCreate(*filename*, *charset*,
*width*)</code></p>

<p>Creates a “log console.” A log console is a special system object that
behaves much like the main game window, except that all of the text
written to a log console is captured in a text file rather than being
displayed.</p>

<p><em>filename</em> is a string giving the name of the file to write, a
<a href="filename.html">FileName</a> object, or a <a href="tempfile.html">TemporaryFile</a>
object; any existing file with the same name will be overwritten.
<em>charset</em> can be a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CharacterSet</code> object, a
string giving the name of a character set, or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> to use the default log file character set.
The text in the log file will be written in the selected character set.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width</code> is the maximum width, in text columns,
for the text written to the file; the console will automatically
word-wrap the written text to this width.</p>

<p>The return value is a “handle,” which identifies the new console in
calls to other logConsoleXxx functions; if the return value is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, the system was unable to create the
console.</p>

<p>If the given file cannot be created (because the name is invalid, for
example, or because there’s no space on disk), a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileCreationException</code> is thrown. The “file
safety” level must allow the operation, otherwise a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileSafetyException</code> is thrown.</p>

<p>Log consoles are in some ways similar to text files based on the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File</code> intrinsic class. The difference is that
text written to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File</code> object is written
character-for-character exactly as you specify. In contrast, the text
written to a log console is processed the same way as text displayed to
the player: HTML markups are processed (although, in a log console, only
the text-only subset of HTML can be used, regardless of the kind of
interpreter being used), the text is word-wrapped (to the fixed width
given when the log console is created), excess whitespace is removed,
and so on.</p>

<p>Log consoles are also similar to the log files created with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setLogFile()</code>. The only difference is that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setLogFile()</code> can only capture text that is
also displayed to the main game window; a log console has no display
component at all, so you can use a log console to capture text
exclusively to a file, without also showing it to the user.</p>

<p>Starting in 3.1.1, the <a href="terp.html#file-safety">file safety</a> settings must
allow write access to the target file. <a href="filename.html">FileName</a> objects
obtained from <a href="tadsio.html#inputFile">inputFile()</a> “save” dialogs are
always accessible.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logConsoleSay(*handle*, ...)</code></p>

<p>Writes the given arguments to the given log console. This behaves just
like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tadsSay()</code>, but writes the text to the
given log console instead of to the main game window. The handle is a
log console handle previously returned from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logConsoleCreate()</code>.</p>

<p>You can also pass the special value
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MainWindowLogHandle</code> for <em>handle</em>. Doing this
writes the text to the main game window’s transcript file, if any - this
is the log file that’s created by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setLogFile(filename, LogTypeTranscript)</code>. If
you pass this special handle value when there isn’t an active transcript
for the main game window, the function is simply ignored; it’s legal to
call it in this case, but it will have no effect. (You can’t use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logConsoleClose()</code> to close this special
handle; to close the main game window’s log file, you must call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setLogFile(nil, LogTypeTranscript)</code>.)</p>

<p>Note that you can also write text to the main game window’s transcript -
without having the text show up in the main window itself - by writing
the text to the main window and enclosing the text in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;LOG\&gt;...\&lt;/LOG\&gt;</code> tags. These tags hide the
text from the display window, but include it in the transcript file.
They’re the complement of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;NOLOG\&gt;...\&lt;/NOLOG\&gt;</code> tags, which you can use
to show text in the game window but exclude it from any transcript file.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;LOG\&gt;...\&lt;/LOG\&gt;</code> sequence is often a
better way than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logConsoleSay()</code> to add text to
the main transcript, since it lets you write the text through the
library’s standard stack of output filters. Calling
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logConsoleSay(MainWindowLogHandle, val)</code> is
best for situations where you specifically want to bypass the normal
output stream handling for the main game window, and instead go directly
to the file.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">morePrompt()</code></p>

<p>Display the MORE prompt on the main console window, and wait for the
user to respond. This can be used when you want to pause execution and
wait for the user to acknowledge some output before proceeding.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resExists(*resname*)</code></p>

<p>Check to see if the given resource can be found. Returns true if the
resource is present, nil if not. For HTML TADS 3, this looks for an HTML
resource; text-only TADS 3 interpreters always return
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> for this function, since they don’t use
multi-media resources at all.</p>

<p>The resource name <em>resname</em> should be specified as a URL-style name
string. The interpreter will look for the resource using the same
searching rules that it uses for normal resource loading; the HTML
interpreter will thus look for the resource bundled into the image file,
in any external resource files (image.3r0 through image.3r9), and
finally in an external file whose name is derived from the URL according
to local system conventions.</p>

<p><span id="setLogFile"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setLogFile(*fname*, *logType*?)</code></p>

<p>Log console output to a file, or stop logging.</p>

<p>If <em>fname</em> is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, this starts logging to
the specified file. <em>fname</em> can be a string giving the name of the file
for saving the log, a <a href="filename.html">FileName</a> object, or a
<a href="tempfile.html">TemporaryFile</a> object. If <em>fname</em> refers to an existing
file, the existing file will be overwritten by the new log output.</p>

<p>If <em>fname</em> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, the function turns off the
specified type of logging, closing the current log file.</p>

<p>logType specifies the type of logging to perform:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogTypeTranscript</code> - create a transcript. All
of the text displayed to the main console (including text read via
command line input) is copied to the file. Any HTML markups are
processed before the text is written to the file; note, though, that
the text-only HTML subset is used, regardless of what kind of
interpreter is running. This is the default log type if the logType
parameter is omitted.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogTypeCommand</code> - create a command log. Only
the input commands are copied to the log file. This creates a
command-line script, suitable for later replay (such as with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile()</code>).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogTypeEvent</code> - create an event script.
Command lines, keys, hyperlink clicks, dialog button clicks, and file
dialog selections are captured to the script, which can later be
replayed (with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile()</code>, for
example).</li>
</ul>

<p>The return value is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> if the operation
succeeded, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> if the file couldn’t be opened.
Opening a file can fail due to the usual file system errors, such as an
invalid filename, insufficient disk space, or file permission errors.
When closing a file (by passing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> for
<em>fname</em>), the function always returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>.</p>

<p>You can record a “transcript” and a “script” file simultaneously, but
only one of each type can be recorded at a time. If you start a new
transcript file (LogTypeTranscript), any previous transcript will be
closed. Similarly, if you start a new script file (LogTypeCommand or
LogTypeScript), any previous script file will be closed. Recordings
don’t nest; starting a new recording simply stops any previous recording
of the same type.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="scripts.html">Input Scripts</a> for more details on scripts,
including the differences between Command-line and Event scripts.</p>

<p>Starting in 3.1.1, the <a href="terp.html#file-safety">file safety</a> settings must
allow write access to the target file. <a href="filename.html">FileName</a> objects
obtained from <a href="tadsio.html#inputFile">inputFile()</a> “save” dialogs are
always accessible.</p>

<p><span id="setScriptFile"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile(*filename*, *flags*?)</code></p>

<p>Start reading commands from a script file, or cancel existing script
input.</p>

<p>If <em>filename</em> is not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, this starts reading
from the given file. <em>filename</em> can be a string containing the name of a
file in the local file system, a <a href="filename.html">FileName</a> object, or a
<a href="tempfile.html">TemporaryFile</a> object.</p>

<p>If <em>filename</em> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, this cancels input from
the current script, as though the end of the file had been reached. If
the current script file is nested within another script, this returns to
the enclosing script.</p>

<p>The optional <em>flags</em> value lets you specify how to read the script file.
The following values can be combined (with the bitwise OR operator
“<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\|</code>”):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ScriptFileQuiet</code> - do not display any output
while reading the script file. If this flag isn’t set, the input lines
read from the script file and the resulting output will be displayed
as though the user had typed the lines of text at the keyboard.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ScriptFileNonstop</code> - turn off the MORE prompt
while reading the script file; output will scroll by without any user
intervention. If this flag isn’t used, the MORE prompt will be
displayed each time the screen fills up with text, and the user will
have to acknowledge the prompt before more output will be displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <em>flags</em> argument is omitted, a default value of 0 will be used,
so none of the flags will be set.</p>

<p>The function returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> on success,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> on error. An error return means that the
script file doesn’t exist or couldn’t be opened. The function always
returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> if <em>filename</em> is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>.</p>

<p>When the interpreter reaches the end of a script file, it automatically
closes the file and returns to normal keyboard input, so calling this
function with <em>filename</em> set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> isn’t
necessary unless you want to explicitly interrupt the script before
reaching the end of the file.</p>

<p>Input scripts can be nested. If
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile()</code> is called with a non-nil
filename when a script file is already in effect, the interpreter will
remember the position in the old script file, then start reading from
the new script file; upon reaching the end of the new script file, or
upon an explicit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile(nil)</code> call, the
interpreter will resume reading from the old script file. Scripts can be
nested in this manner to any depth. This allows one script file to
“include” another, for example.</p>

<p>See <a href="scripts.html">Script Files</a> for information on how input scripts are
interpreted.</p>

<p><strong>Status queries:</strong> In version 3.0.17 and later, this function can also
query the current script playback status. To get the status, use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile(ScriptReqGetStatus)</code>. If input is
currently being read from the keyboard, the return value is nil. If a
script is being played back, the return value is an integer giving a
combination of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ScriptFileXxx</code> flags describing
the playback mode. Note that a return value of 0 (zero) indicates that a
script <strong>is</strong> being played back, but that none of the mode flags apply.</p>

<p>In addition to the flags defined above, the flag
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ScriptFileEvent</code> is included in the status
value if the current script is an event script rather than a
command-line script. Note that this flag is ignored if you include it in
the ‘flags’ argument when calling
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setScriptFile()</code> to start playback of a new
script; the script reader automatically determines whether the new
script is an event script or a command-line script by examining the
file’s contents. The purpose of this additional flag is to let you find
out what the script reader decided about the current script.</p>

<p>If you call the function in this form on VM versions prior to 3.0.17,
the function will throw a RuntimeError, because earlier implementations
only accepted a string or nil for the first argument. You can use
try-catch to handle this situation: if the function throws a
RuntimeError (with errno_ == 2019), it means that you’re running on a
version of the VM that doesn’t support the function.</p>

<p>Starting in 3.1.1, the <a href="terp.html#file-safety">file safety</a> settings must
allow read access to the target file. <a href="filename.html">FileName</a> objects
obtained from <a href="tadsio.html#inputFile">inputFile()</a> “open” dialogs are
always accessible.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">statusMode(*mode*)</code></p>

<p>Set the “status line mode.” This can be used to control the status line
in non-HTML mode and for older text-only interpreters that don’t support
the Banner API. The <em>mode</em> setting controls where text is displayed;
this can be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StatModeNormal</code> - text is displayed in the
main text area</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StatModeStatus</code> - text is displayed to the
left portion of the status line</li>
</ul>

<p>To write to the status line in non-HTML mode and on text-only
interpreters, set the status mode to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StatModeStatus</code>, write the status line text as
though it were ordinary display output, and finally set the status mode
back to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StatModeNormal</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    statusMode(StatModeStatus);
    "Loud Room";
    statusMode(StatModeNormal);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">statusRight(*txt*)</code></p>

<p>Write the text string <em>txt</em> to the right half of the status line. This
can be used to control the right portion of the status line on older
text-only interpreters that don’t support the Banner API.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemInfo(*infoType*, ...)</code></p>

<p>Retrieve information about the TADS 3 application environment. This
retrieves information on the interpreter and operating system that’s
running the program.</p>

<p><em>infoType</em> is one of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoXxx</code> constants
listed below; it specifies the type of information being requested.
Additional parameters vary according to the <em>infoType</em> value; unless
otherwise specified, no additional parameters are used. The return value
contains the information requested; the type and meaning vary according
to the <em>infoType</em> code.</p>

<p>This API is designed to allow for future
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysTypeXxx</code> codes to be added in future
versions, as follows. In particular, it’s legal to pass an arbitrary
integer value for <em>infoType</em>; if the interpreter doesn’t recognize the
selector value, it will always return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> as
the result of the function. This allows a newer game to use a recently
added selector code, and still get meaningful results from an older
interpreter that was released before that selector code was added.
Therefore, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> is a special return value for
this function: it always means either that the selector isn’t
recognized, or that the selector is recognized but the feature it asks
about isn’t present; in either case, it tells the caller that the
feature being queried can’t be used.</p>

<p>The <em>infoType</em> codes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoInterpClass</code> - get the interpreter
“class,” which indicates the broad capabilities of the interpreter.
The following classes are defined:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoIClassText</code> - character-mode
text-only interpreter, such as Unix TADS or MS-DOS TADS. These
interpreters use a single, fixed-pitch font, cannot display any
graphics, and support only the text-only HTML subset.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoIClassTextGUI</code> - GUI text-only
interpreter, such as WinTADS or MacTADS. These interpreters behave
essentially the same as character-mode interpreters, but run on
graphical operating systems and thus might use proportional fonts,
boldface text, and so on. These interpreters can’t display graphics
explicitly, but might use some graphics automatically (for drawing
window borders, for example). These support only the text-only HTML
subset.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoIClassHTML</code> - a full HTML
interpreter running on a graphical platform, such as HTML TADS for
Windows, CocoaTADS for Mac OS X, or QTads for Linux, Unix, and Mac
OS X. These interpreters can use multiple fonts of varying sizes,
including proportional fonts, can display graphics and play sounds,
and recognize the full HTML TADS markup language.</p>

        <p>Note that the advent of the Web UI in TADS 3.1 clouds the picture a
little bit. With the Web UI, the game’s user interface runs in a
browser that’s separate from the interpreter, and the <em>browser</em>
always uses HTML even if the interpreter doesn’t. The interpreter
class indicates the capabilities of the <em>built-in user interface</em> in
the interpreter, which Web UI games generally don’t use at all. If
you’re writing for the Web UI, the actual user interface is always a
browser, and is therefore always HTML capable, regardless of the
interpreter class. Note that you don’t need to worry about whether
or not the interpreter supports the Web UI, because this is handled
at load time: a game that uses the Web UI simply won’t load on an
interpreter that doesn’t support the Web UI, since that interpreter
won’t have the necessary intrinsic classes and functions that the
game requires.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoVersion</code> - get the interpreter version
information. The return value is a string of the form ‘3.0.10’ giving
the major, minor, and point-release numbers.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoOsName</code> - get the OS name. This
returns a string giving a short name for the operating system ‘MSDOS’,
‘WIN32’, ‘Mac OS’, etc.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoJpeg</code> - can the renderer display JPEG
images? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoPng</code> - can the renderer display PNG
images? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoWav</code> - can the system play WAVE
sounds? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoMidi</code> - can the system play MIDI
sounds? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoWavMidiOvl</code> - can the system play WAVE
and MIDI sounds simultaneously? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoWavOvl</code> - can the system play multiple
WAVE sounds simultaneously? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoPrefImages</code> - do the user’s
preferences allow images to be displayed? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoPrefSounds</code> - do the user’s
preferences allow sound effects to be played? Returns 1 if so, 0 if
not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoPrefMusic</code> - do the user’s preferences
allow music to be played? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoPrefLinks</code> - do the user’s preferences
allow hyperlinks to be displayed distinctively (i.e., not as ordinary
text, but using a special style to indicate that they’re links)?
Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoMpeg</code> - can the system play MPEG
sounds of any kind? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoMpeg1</code> - can the system play MPEG
layer 1 (MP1) sounds? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoMpeg2</code> - can the system play MPEG
layer 2 (MP2) sounds? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoMpeg3</code> - can the system play MPEG
layer 3 (MP3) sounds? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoLinksHttp</code> - can the system follow
hyperlinks that use the “http:” scheme? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoLinksFtp</code> - can the system follow
hyperlinks that use the “ftp:” scheme? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>

hyperlinks that use the “news:” scheme? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoLinksMailto</code> - can the system follow
hyperlinks that use the “mailto:” scheme? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoLinksTelnet</code> - can the system follow
hyperlinks that use the “telnet:” scheme? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoPngTrans</code> - can the system properly
display transparent PNG’s overlayed on their backgrounds? Returns 1 if
so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoPngAlpha</code> - can the system use
alpha-channel (partial transparency) blending in PNG’s? Returns 1 if
so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoOgg</code> - can the system play Ogg Vorbis
sounds? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoMng</code> - can the system display MNG
images? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoMngTrans</code> - can the system properly
display transparent MNG’s overlayed on their backgrounds? Returns 1 if

  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoTextHilite</code> - can the system render
highlighted text (text in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;B\&gt;...\&lt;/B\&gt;</code>
tags) distinctively? Returns 1 if so, 0 if not.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoTextColors</code> - does the system provide
control text colors (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;FONT COLOR=xxx\&gt;</code>
tags)? Returns one of the following codes indicating the level of
support provided:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> - the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoTextColors</code> code is not recognized
by the system</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoTxcNone</code> - no text color control is
provided; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;FONT COLOR\&gt;</code> is ignored</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoTxcParam</code> - some or all of the
parameterized color names <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(BGCOLOR</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TEXT</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STATUSBG</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STATUSTEXT</code>, etc.) can be used with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;FONT COLOR=xxx\&gt;</code>, but specific colors
will be ignored</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoTxcAnsiFg</code> - the ANSI colors (black,
white, red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta) can be used as
foreground colors, but background colors cannot be set</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoTxcAnsiFgBg</code> - the ANSI colors can
be used as foreground and background colors.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoTxcRGB</code> - any RGB color can be used
for foreground and background colors. (This is the code normally
returned by the HTML interpreters. This doesn’t necessarily indicate
that the user is running in a 24-bit graphic mode; it simply
indicates that the system accepts arbitrary RGB colors and will
display them with the best fidelity possible.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoBanners</code> - does the system support the
banner window API?</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoAudioFade</code> - does the system support
audio fades? This returns nil or 0 if fades aren’t supported at all;
otherwise it returns an integer giving a bitwise combination of the
codes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoFadeMPEG</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoFadeOGG</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoFadeWAV</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoFadeMIDI</code> indicating which formats can
be used with audio fades. (Audio fading is an HTML TADS feature,
accessed through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;SOUND\&gt;</code> tag.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoAudioCrossfade</code> - does the system
support audio cross-fades? This returns nil or 0 if cross-fades aren’t
supported at all; otherwise it returns an integer giving a bitwise
combination of codes indicating which formats allow cross-fades. The
codes have the same meanings as the codes returns for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SysInfoAudioFade</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span id="tadsSay"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tadsSay(*val*, ...)</code></p>

<p>Display one or more values. Each value is displayed on the console,
starting with the first argument; the displayed values are not separated
by any spaces or other delimiters. The formatting for each value depends
upon its type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>string: the text of the string is displayed</li>
  <li>integer: the decimal representation of the number is displayed</li>
  <li>BigNumber: the number is displayed with the default formatting</li>
  <li>list or Vector: the elements of the list or Vector are displayed in
order, separated by commas</li>
  <li>nil: nothing is displayed</li>
  <li>objects with implicit string conversions (e.g., a
<a href="bytearr.html">ByteArray</a> or <a href="date.html">Date</a> object) are converted to
strings using their default string formatting, and the the results are
displayed; see the <a href="tadsgen.html#toString">toString()</a> function</li>
  <li>any other type is invalid; a run-time error is generated (“invalid
type for built-in function”)</li>
</ul>

<p>The function has no return value.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeDelay(*delay*)</code></p>

<p>Pause execution for the given number of milliseconds. The precision of
system timers varies, so the actual delay might differ somewhat from the
exact time specified on some systems according to the available hardware
timer precision.</p>

<h2 id="real-time-input"><span id="rtinput"></span>Real-time input</h2>

<p>A real-time event is an event that occurs at a particular point in
“wall-clock” time; for example, an event programmed to occur at 9:00 PM
is a real-time event, because it’s scheduled according to time in the
real world. It’s more typical to schedule a real-time event to occur
after some number of seconds or minutes has elapsed than to schedule one
for a particular time on the clock on the wall, but elapsed-time events
are also real-time events, because they depend on the passage of time on
the clock.</p>

<p>In most programs that take their input from a command line (say, text
adventure games), reading a command line from the user stops everything
until the user finishes entering the command by pressing Enter. This is
known as a “blocking” operation, because the operation blocks the
program’s progress until the command line is finished: the program
simply waits as long as it takes for the user to type the command line
and press the Enter key. For this reason, command-line programs don’t
usually incorporate real-time events, and most programs with real-time
events don’t use command lines.</p>

<p>TADS 3 has the ability to mix command-line input and real-time events,
thanks to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> function.
This section describes how to use this feature.</p>

<p>Note that the information below applies to the low-level system API. If
you’re using the adv3 library, you won’t have to worry about any of
these details, because adv3’s input and output managers work together
with its real-time event manager to handle all of this for you
automatically. With adv3, you simply create real-time event objects
describing the event timeline, and the library’s input manager handles
everything else.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> function works a lot
like the ordinary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLine()</code> function, which
reads a line of text from the keyboard and returns a string containing
the text, but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> has the
additional feature of letting you specify a time limit, called a
“timeout.” A timeout is simply a maximum real-time interval; when the
interval expires, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> returns,
even if the user hasn’t finished editing the command line. The function
returns information that lets you tell whether or not the user finished
editing the command before the timeout expired. (If the user finished
entering the command and presses Enter <em>before</em> the timeout expires, the
function returns immediately - the timeout is the <em>longest</em> the function
will wait to return, but it can return sooner if the user types fast
enough.)</p>

<p>At the simplest level, you could imagine a game that imposes a time
limit for typing certain commands. For example, a sadistic game designer
might want to design a traditional adventure game maze, with the novel
twist that the player has to move out of each room within ten seconds of
real time or face some penalty, such as being moved back to the start of
the maze. To do this, you could use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> with a timeout value of
10000 (ten thousand milliseconds equals ten seconds), imposing the
penalty if the function ever returns with a timeout.</p>

<p>This type of use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code>
wouldn’t win many admirers, but fortunately it’s not at all the scenario
for which this function was designed. In fact, the key feature of the
function is that it not only allows you to interrupt a command line, but
also allows you to <em>resume</em> an interrupted command line. This is
crucial: because you can resume an interrupted command line, you can
write your program so that it continues to process events in real time,
even while the user is editing a command; the user’s editing and your
real-time events can proceed in parallel, with neither blocking the
other.</p>

<p>There are three possible ways to use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1: Limited-time input.</strong> This is the real-time-maze scenario
described above, where the program solicits command-line input from the
user, but only allows the user a limited amount of time to complete the
input. In this scenario, when the time limit expires, the user’s chance
to enter a command has ended: the program does not allow the user to
resume editing the command later.</p>

<p>This is the simplest scenario, because the program unconditionally
cancels the input when it times out. To do this, you simply call the
function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel()</code> when a timeout
occurs. Here’s how this looks:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    /* read a command, with a 10-second time limit */
    local result = inputLineTimeout(10000);
    if (result[1] == InEvtTimeout)
    {
      /* timed out - cancel input and forget the buffer */
      inputLineCancel(true);

      /*
       *  gloat about defeating the user with our clever time
       *  limit ruse, using the spelling enjoyed by usenet
       *  posters everywhere
       */
      "Ha, ha!  You LOOSE!";
      // etc
    }
    else
    {
      /* darn, they were fast enough */
      // move to the new location, etc
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: Internal computation only, with resumed editing.</strong>
Sometimes you’ll want to perform some operation at a particular time,
but the operation won’t perform any display operations. For example,
suppose you’re writing a detective game, and you have one character in
the game who moves around according to a real-time schedule. When you’re
about to read an input line, you can check the character’s schedule,
calculate the delay until the character’s next move, and then use that
delay as the timeout value for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code>.</p>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> returns a timeout event,
you’d move your character according to the schedule. Now, suppose the
character isn’t in sight of the player character at any point during the
scheduled travel. In this case, you wouldn’t want to display anything
about the character’s travel: everything happens behind the scenes. So,
you need to perform the event in real time, so that the character moves
to its new location on schedule, but as far as the player is concerned,
nothing happened.</p>

<p>In this case, you’d simply call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> again after moving the
character. The function would pick up where it left off, with absolutely
no effects visible to the player. Nothing on the display changes in this
case, so the player simply thinks they’ve been editing the same command
all along.</p>

<p>The code for this is easy, as long as we can take for granted that we
know when the character’s next move occurs.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    /* show the initial prompt */
    "&gt;";

    /* keep looping forever */
    for (;;)
    {
      local delay;
      local result;

      /* calculate the interval until the next travel */
      delay = actor.nextMoveTime - getTime(GetTimeTicks);

      /* ask for input, waiting no longer than the timeout */
      evt = inputLineTimeout(delay);

      /* if we timed out, move the character */
      if (result[1] == InEvtTimeout)
      {
        /* time to go */
        actor.performNextTravel();
      }
      else
      {
        /* they entered a command - handle it */
        processCommand(result[2]);

        /* show the prompt again */
        "&gt;";

      }
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that it’s legal to update banner windows during interrupted input.
You could use code just like the example above, substituting banner
window displays for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">performNextTravel()</code>
call. For example, you could keep a running real-time clock in a banner
window, updating it at each input timeout. As long as you’re not
updating the main window, where the input editing session is taking
place, it’s not necessary to cancel input editing (as described in the
next scenario).</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 3: Interruption with a displayed message, then resumed
editing.</strong> This is the most complex situation, but in many ways the most
interesting. In this scenario, we want to tell the user about something
that happened during the real-time event, but we still want to let the
user go back to editing the command line after we finish processing the
event.</p>

<p>Our detective example above fits this scenario when the traveling actor
is in sight of the player character, because in this case we want to
tell the user that the traveling actor has departed or arrived. Once
we’ve described the departure or arrival, though, we want to let the
user continue editing the command, because the interruption doesn’t
necessarily change what they would have typed, and (unlike Scenario 1)
doesn’t take away the user’s chance to type a command.</p>

<p>In this situation, we have to use the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel()</code> function, passing
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> as the <em>reset</em> argument. This function
tells the system that we are <strong>not</strong> processing Scenario 2; in
particular, it tells the system that it won’t be able to pretend that
the interruption never happened. The reason we have to differentiate
this case from Scenario 2 is that when
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> returns with a timeout, the
system optimistically keeps everything on the screen and in memory in a
state where it could resume editing the same command later. This means
that any display operations - even something as simple as displaying a
string of text - would leave things terribly confused, because the
system is holding everything ready for more command line editing. To
tell the system that we wish to give up our right to resume editing with
complete transparency, and in exchange receive the right to perform
other display operations, we use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel(nil)</code>.</p>

<p>Note that we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> for reset argument to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel()</code> in this scenario. This is
because we wish to resume editing the command line later. This might
seem confusing - if we want to resume editing the command later, why are
we canceling in the first place? The solution to this seeming
contradiction is that canceling and resetting are not the same thing.
Canceling, which is what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel()</code>
does regardless of the <em>reset</em> argument, simply tells the system to give
up hope for transparently resuming editing. Resetting, which only occurs
when the <em>reset</em> argument to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel()</code>
is true, tells the system to throw away all information about editing.
So, when you cancel without resetting, you tell the system that you
won’t transparently resume editing, but that you still wish to resume
editing later, albeit not transparently.</p>

<p>Here’s what this looks like to the user. First, here’s the way the
screen looks when the user is first presented with the command line:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>What do you, the detective, want to do next?
&gt;|
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(That vertical bar, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\|</code>, is meant to represent
the cursor, where text the user types is inserted.) Now, the user starts
typing a command, and the screen looks like this after a bit:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>What do you, the detective, want to do next?
&gt;look at the v|
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, at this point, our timeout expires, and we discover that it’s time
to move Miss Marmalade into the same room where the player character is
located. We call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel(nil)</code> to tell
the system that we wish to perform some output operations in lieu of
resuming editing transparently, then we add our displayed messages.
Finally, we call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code> again to
resume editing. Here’s what the user sees:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>What do you, the detective, want to do next?
&gt;look at the v

Miss Marmalade enters from the north.  She pretends
not to see you, busying herself with rummaging for
something in her purse.

&gt;look at the v|
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the partially-constructed command line now appears twice on
the screen - once before the interruption, and again after. The first
copy is no longer the active command line; it’s left on screen only to
maintain continuity, so that the user isn’t startled by the text
suddenly disappearing. After this, we see the text displayed during the
real-time interruption, and finally we see the new command line, where
we’ve reinstated the text the user has entered so far, as well as the
original cursor position.</p>

<p>This is what we mean by “non-transparent” resumption of editing. The
resumption isn’t transparent, in that the user can plainly see on the
screen that the editing was interrupted. We are nonetheless resuming the
editing session fairly seamlessly. If the user had their eyes closed,
they could keep editing the command without knowing that we interrupted
them, because the text on the line, the cursor position, and all other
editing state is the same as it was before the interruption; the only
thing that has changed is that more text is on the screen than when we
started.</p>

<p>The code for this case is almost exactly the same as the example code in
Scenario 2, with two changes. First, we must call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineCancel(nil)</code> before we display the
message about Miss Marmalde moving; we’d put this call just before the
call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actor.performNextTravel()</code>. Second,
we’d have to re-display the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&gt;</code> prompt before
we resume editing the command; we could do this before the call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputLineTimeout()</code>.</p>
