<h1 id="tadsobject">TadsObject</h1>

<p>The objects and classes that you define in your program are of intrinsic
class TadsObject. Everything that has “object” as its superclass is
really a subclass of intrinsic class TadsObject.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class Item: object;
    myObj: object;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both Item and myObj are of intrinsic class TadsObject.</p>

<h2 id="tadsobject-methods">TadsObject methods</h2>

<p>TadsObject is a subclass of the root intrinsic class, Object, so all of
the methods that Object defines are inherited by TadsObject instances as
well. In addition to the Object methods, TadsObject provides its own
methods, described below.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createClone()</code></p>

<p>Creates a new object that is an identical copy of this object. The new
object will have the same superclasses as the original, and the
identical set of properties defined in the original.</p>

<p>No constructor is called in creating the new object, since the object is
explicitly initialized by this method to have the exact property values
of the original.</p>

<p>The clone is a “shallow” copy of the original, which means that the
clone refers to all of the same objects as the original. For example, if
a property of the original points to a Vector, the corresponding
property of the clone points to the same Vector, not a copy of the
Vector.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createInstance(...)</code></p>

<p>Creates a new instance of the target object. This method’s arguments are
passed directly to the constructor, if any, of the new object; this
method doesn’t make any other use of the arguments. The method creates
the object, invokes the new object’s constructor, then returns the new
object.</p>

<p>This method can be especially useful in static methods defined in base
classes that are further subclassed, because it essentially allows a
parameterized “new” operator. For example, suppose we had a base class,
Coin, which you subclass into several types: GoldCoin, SilverCoin,
CopperCoin. For each of these classes, you want to provide a method that
creates a new instance of that kind of coin. Using the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> operator, you’d have to write a separate
method in each subclass:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class Coin: object;
    class GoldCoin: Coin
      createCoin() { return new GoldCoin(); }
    ;
    class SilverCoin: Coin
      createCoin() { return new SilverCoin(); }
    ;
    class CopperCoin: Coin
      createCoin() { return new CopperCoin(); }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This gets increasingly tedious as we add new subclasses. What we’d
really like to do is something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class Coin: object
      createCoin() { return new self(); } // illegal!
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would let all the subclasses inherit this one implementation, which
would create the appropriate kind of object depending on the subclass on
which the method was invoked. We can’t write exactly this code, though,
because the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> operator doesn’t allow a
variable like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> to be used as its argument.</p>

<p>So, it’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createInstance()</code> to the rescue. This
method lets us do exactly what we’d like: create an instance of the
current class, writing the code only once in the base class. Using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createInstance(),</code> we can rewrite the method to
get the effect we want:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class Coin: object
      createCoin() { return createInstance(); }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createInstanceOf(...)</code></p>

<p>Creates a new instance based on multiple superclasses. This is a static
(class-level) method, so you can call it directly on TadsObject. With no
arguments, this simply creates a basic TadsObject instance; this is
equivalent to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createInstance()</code> method.</p>

<p>The arguments give the superclasses, in “dominance” order. The
superclasses appear in the argument list in the same order in which
they’d appear in an object definition: the first argument corresponds to
the leftmost superclass in an ordinary object definition. Each argument
is either a class or a list. If an argument is a list, the first element
of the list must be a class, and the remainder of the elements are the
arguments to pass to that class’s constructor. If an argument is simply
a class (not a list), then the constructor for this superclass is not
invoked at all.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we had the following class definitions:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class A: object
      construct(a, b) { ... }
    ;

    class B: object
      construct(a, b, c) { ... }
    ;

    class C: object
      construct() { ... }
    ;

    class D: A, B, C
      construct(x, y)
      {
        inherited A(x, y);
        inherited C();

      }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, suppose that we had never actually defined class D, but we want to
create an instance dynamically as though it class D had been defined. We
could obtain this effect like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local d = TadsObject.createInstanceOf([A, x, y], B, [C]);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This creates a new instance with superclasses A, B, and C, in that
dominance order. During construction of the new object, we will inherit
A’s constructor, passing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(x,y)</code> as arguments,
and we’ll inherit C’s constructor with no arguments. Note that we pass a
list containing C alone; this indicates that we do want to call the
constructor, since the argument is passed as a list rather than as
simply the object C, but that we have no arguments to send to C’s
constructor. Note also that we don’t invoke B’s constructor at all,
since B is specified without being wrapped in a list.</p>

<p>Note that if constructors are invoked at all, they can only be called in
the same order in which they appear in the superclass list.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createTransientInstance(...)</code></p>

<p>This works like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createInstance()</code>, except that
the new instance is transient.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createTransientInstanceOf(...)</code></p>

<p>This works like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createInstanceOf()</code>, except
that the new instance is transient.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getMethod(*prop*)</code></p>

<p>Gets a function pointer to one of the object’s methods. <em>prop</em> is a
property pointer value giving the property of the object to retrieve. If
this property contains a method, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getMethod()</code>
returns a function pointer to the method’s code. If the property
contains a self-printing string, the return value is an ordinary string
value with the text of the printed string. If the property is any other
type of data, or is undefined, the result is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>.</p>

<p>Note that a double-quoted string that contains embedded (“interpolated”)
expressions with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt; \&gt;\&gt;</code> is really a
function. This means that if you call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getMethod()</code> on a property containing a string
with embedded expressions, you’ll get back a function pointer result
rather than a string expression.</p>

<p>When the returned value is a function, it can be called like an ordinary
function. You wouldn’t normally do this, though, because the call would
have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> value for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>, which means that the method would
trigger a run-time error if it tried to access any properties or other
methods of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>. Instead, the main use for the
returned function pointer would be to assign the function as a different
method of the same object, or as a method of another object, using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMethod()</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getMethod()</code> can also return an
anonymous function object. Methods originally defined in the source code
will always be returned as regular function pointers (of type
TypeFuncPtr). An anonymous function will be returned only for a method
that was explicitly set to an anonymous functions via
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMethod()</code>. In this case, the same anonymous
function object that was passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMethod()</code>
will be returned from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getMethod()</code>.</p>

<p>(Ordinary methods are also “anonymous” functions in that they’re not
named. But these aren’t what we normally call anonymous function
objects, which are the type of object created with the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">function</code> syntax.)</p>

<p><span id="setMethod"></span></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMethod(*prop*, *func*)</code></p>

<p>Assigns the function <em>func</em> as a method of the object, using the
property <em>prop</em>.</p>

<p><em>prop</em> is the property pointer to assign. This specifies the property
that will be used for the newly assigned method. Any previous method or
data value for this property will be replaced with the new function.</p>

<p><em>func</em> can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A regular (named) function pointer, which becomes a method with the
same arguments as the function. The function itself isn’t changed by
this; you can also still call it directly as an ordinary function.</li>
  <li>A <a href="proccode.html#floatingMethods">floating method</a> pointer, which
becomes a method with the same arguments.</li>
  <li>An anonymous function, which becomes a method with the same arguments
as the anonymous function. The anonymous function itself isn’t changed
in any way by this; you can still call it directly, too.</li>
  <li>An anonymous method, which becomes a method with the same arguments as
the anonymous method.</li>
  <li>A <a href="dynfunc.html">DynamicFunc</a>, which becomes a method with the same
arguments as the dynamically compiled code.</li>
  <li>A single-quoted string value, which will be displayed on evaluating
the property, as though it had been initially defined as a
double-quoted string property of the object.</li>
  <li>Any value retrieved by a call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getMethod()</code>, on this object or any other
object.</li>
</ul>

<p>After calling this method, invoking <em>prop</em> on this object will result in
calling the function <em>func</em> as though it had always been a method of the
object. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> will be set, and the method can
use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited</code> to inherit from this object’s
class structure.</p>

<p>It’s important to note how the naming works. The new method is callable
under the name <em>prop</em> - <strong>not</strong> under the name of the function that was
used to create it. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    method foo(x) { return x*x; }
    obj: object;

    main(args)
    {
      obj.setMethod(&amp;square, foo);
      local x = obj.square(10);
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The name of the new method is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">square</code>, <em>not</em>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> is still
just a floating method; the new, full-fledged method is established
under the property name, not the function name.</p>

<p>The method relationship created by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMethod()</code>
is non-exclusive. You’re free to use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMethod()</code> to assign the same function
pointer (or other value) as a method of multiple objects at once. The
value doesn’t lose its regular meaning, either: as we said above, if you
supply a function pointer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMethod()</code>, you
can still call the same function as an ordinary function, too.</p>

<p>Note that when you define an ordinary function, the compiler doesn’t let
you refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> or any other method context
variables (such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">targetprop</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">definingobj</code>) within the function body, since
these variables normally aren’t valid in a function. This also means
that you can’t define a function that uses
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delegated</code>. There are two ways of dealing with
this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, you can define a method of one object, and “move” it to a
different object: use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getMethod()</code> to
retrieve the method information from the original object, and pass the
result to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMethod()</code> to add the method to
the other object. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> and the other method
context variables are dynamic, so they’ll automatically reflect the
new object context when you call the moved version of the method.
(This doesn’t really move the method; it really just copies it. You
can still call it in the old object as well, where it will still
reflect its original context.) This is a good approach when you need
the same method functionality in an ordinary object anyway, since you
can simply copy it as needed to new objects.</li>
  <li>Second, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">method</code> syntax to
define a <a href="proccode.html#floatingMethods">floating method</a>, which is
really just an ordinary function that <em>does</em> have access to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">targetprop</code>,
and the others, and that can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delegated</code>. This is a good approach when
the function’s only purpose is to be plugged into objects via
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMethod()</code>, since it avoids creating a
dummy template object just to define a method.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you use an anonymous function with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setMethod()</code>, you should keep in mind that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> and the other method context variables
are shared with the scope where the function was defined. Consider this
example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    obj1: object
       init()
       {
           obj2.setMethod(&amp;a, { x: self.prop = x; });
       }
    ;
    obj2: object
       prop = nil
    ;

    main(args)
    {
        obj1.init();
        obj2.a(100);
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we’ve set up a new method for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj2</code>, named
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>. We then invoke the new method. The question
is: what’s the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj2.prop</code> when we’re
done? At first glance you might think it should be 100, since the newly
created method sets <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self.prop</code> to the argument
value, and the new method is part of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj2</code>,
ergo we must be setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj2.prop</code> to 100. But
that’s not what happens: the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj2.prop</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>
when we’re done.</p>

<p>The reason is the little detail we mentioned about how an anonymous
function shares its method context with its lexically enclosing scope.
Because the anonymous function was created within the confines of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj1.init</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>
in effect at the moment of the function’s creation was
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj1</code>. And this is the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> that the function will use forever, no
matter how many times it’s invoked. It’s in the nature of an anonymous
function: it shares everything with its lexically enclosing scope,
including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>.</p>

<p>In this example, though, that’s not the effect we’re after. We’d like
instead to create a method that assigns a value to the property
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prop</code> of whatever object we attach the method
to. In other words, we want to create a real live method, not a function
that’s stuck to someone else’s method context.</p>

<p>The way to do this is to replace the anonymous function with an
anonymous method. An anonymous method <em>isn’t</em> stuck to the method
context that was in effect when it was created, but instead uses the
live context whenever it’s called. This is an easy change to make: we
just need to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">method</code> syntax to define
the anonymous method.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    obj2.setMethod(&amp;a, method(x) { self.prop = x; });
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this change, running the program will indeed set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj2.prop</code> to 100.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setSuperclassList(*lst*)</code></p>

<p>Sets the object’s superclasses to the values in <em>lst</em>, which must be a
list (or <a href="opoverload.html#listlike">list-like object</a>) containing
objects. The object’s superclass list is replaced with the given
superclass list. The objects in <em>lst</em> must all be TadsObject objects,
with one exception: lst is allowed to be
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[TadsObject\]</code> (that is, a single-element list
containing the TadsObject class itself), in which case the object
becomes a root TadsObject object.
