<h1 id="stackframedesc">StackFrameDesc</h1>

<p>The StackFrameDesc (“desc” for “descriptor”) class provides access to
the local variables and method context variables
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">definingobj</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">targetprop</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">targetobj</code>) in an active stack frame. This lets
you retrieve and change the values of local variables in a calling
function, and to retrieve the method context information. This type of
manipulation isn’t commonly used in ordinary programming tasks, but it’s
occasionally useful for special cases, especially for utility libraries
that implement things like extension languages or debugging facilities.
It also lets you create <a href="dynfunc.html">dynamically compiled functions</a>
that can access the local variables in calling frames.</p>

<p>A “stack frame” is a storage area within the TADS 3 virtual machine that
represents a function or method call in progress. The frame contains the
local variables for the routine along with its method context variables,
plus information on where control passes when the routine returns to its
caller. It’s called a “frame” because it’s a self-contained chunk of
memory that’s reserved for the use of that one active routine. These
frames are arranged into a “stack,” which is a data structure perfectly
suited for the way control flows from a caller to a callee and then to
another callee: each time a new function is called, the frame for the
new one is piled on top of the last one; when a callee returns, its
frame is taken off the pile, which restores its caller as the active
frame.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-a-stackframedesc-object">How to get a StackFrameDesc object</h2>

<p>You can’t create StackFrameDesc objects using the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> operator. Instead, you obtain them from
the
<a href="t3vm.html#t3GetStackTrace"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t3GetStackTrace()</code></a>
function. This function returns a trace of the active call stack, which
contains information on each caller of the current routine. One of the
bits of information that you can get for each caller is a StackFrameDesc
object for its stack frame. To get the StackFrameDesc, you must include
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T3GetStackDesc</code> flag in the call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t3GetStackTrace()</code>. This tells the function to
include the frame descriptor object, and store it in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frameDesc\_</code> property of each stack trace item.</p>

<p>Here’s an example that retrieves the StackFrameDesc object for the
immediate caller. The current, active routine (the routine that’s
running right now) is always at level 1, so the immediate caller is at
level 2. We thus ask the stack trace function to give us information for
stack level 2, and we specify the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T3GetStackDesc</code> flag to request the frame
descriptor object.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local frame = t3GetStackTrace(2, T3GetStackDesc).frameDesc_;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you have the frame descriptor object, you can call its methods to
retrieve information on the stack frame and manipulate its local
variables.</p>

<h2 id="stack-frame-lifetime">Stack frame lifetime</h2>

<p>A stack frame is inherently ephemeral, because it represents a running
function or method. The frame doesn’t represent the function or method
itself - it merely represents the current <em>invocation</em> of the function
or method. When that call to the routine exits, either because the
routine uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> to return control to its
caller or because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">throw</code> transfers control back
to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">catch</code> block in a caller, the stack frame
representing the call ceases to exist.</p>

<p>A stack frame is still valid during times when the function or method is
suspended waiting for another routine it called to return. The frame
only expires when its function or method returns or throws an error that
returns control to a caller.</p>

<p>Unlike the underlying stack frame, a StackFrameDesc object <em>doesn’t</em>
disappear when the routine associated with the stack frame exits. A
StackFrameDesc object is only a <em>description</em> of a stack frame, so it
can continue to exist after the frame it points to has been deleted.</p>

<p>When a stack frame is destroyed, but a StackFrameDesc object that points
to the frame still exists, the system automatically makes a “snapshot”
of the local variables in the frame. That is, it makes a private copy of
the variables, and stores it with the StackFrameDesc object. After that
point, whenever you use the StackFrameDesc object to access the local
variables, the StackFrameDesc will simply use its private snapshot copy
instead of going to the true stack frame. This is all done
automatically; you don’t have to do anything different in your code.</p>

<p>You can specifically test a StackFrameDesc to see if the frame is still
alive, using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isActive()</code> method. This
returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> if the stack frame is still
active, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> if the routine has already
exited (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">throw</code>).</p>

<p>Note that stack frame lifetime is only an issue if you pass a stack
frame from one routine to another (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code>,
for example, or by storing it in an object property). If you only use a
frame descriptor within the routine that obtained it, the frame won’t
become invalid during the time you’re using it, since the only way for
it to become invalid is for the method or function call it represents to
return - and <em>that</em> can’t happen until the current routine returns
first.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-local-variables">Accessing local variables</h2>

<p>To access local variables in the stack frame, you use the indexing
operator, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[\]</code>, with the name of a local
variable as the index value. Use a single-quoted string for the name.</p>

<p>For example, to access local variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>, you’d
simply write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frame\['i'\]</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s a more complete example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    main(args)
    {
      for (local i = 1 ; i &lt;= 10 ; ++i)
        f(i);
    }

    f(x)
    {
      // Get the stack frame information for our caller.  The first level of
      // the stack trace is always the current routine; we're interested in
      // the routine that called us, which is at level 2.  Use the T3GetStackDesc
      // flag to retrieve the StackFrameDesc object for the frame.
      local t = t3GetStackTrace(2, T3GetStackDesc);

      // get the frame object from the stack level description
      local f = t.frameDesc_;

      // show the value of local variable 'i' in the caller
      "The caller's value of i is &lt;&lt;f['i']&gt;&gt;.\n";
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you attempt to access a local variable that doesn’t exist in the
frame, the system will throw a run-time error (“index out of range”).</p>

<p>You can assign a new value to a variable in the frame using the normal
assignment syntax:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    f['i'] = 100;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As long as the underlying stack frame is still active, all access to the
local variables will directly read and write the <strong>live</strong> values. That
means that any changes you make will change the actual local variables
in the function or method associated with the stack frame. Likewise, any
changes that the routine itself makes will be visible.</p>

<p>When the routine associated with the stack frame exits, the actual stack
frame will be deleted, along with its local variables. However, the
StackFrameDesc object will automatically make a snapshot copy of the
locals at that very moment - so it will have the latest values as they
were just before the routine exited. From that point on, access to the
local variables through the StackFrameDesc object will use the snapshot.
You can still make changes, but the changes will only update the
snapshot, since the true local variables will no longer exist.</p>

<h2 id="stackframedesc-methods">StackFrameDesc methods</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getDefiningObj()</code></p>

<p>Retrieves the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">definingobj</code> from the
frame, returning the value. This is the object which actually contains
the definition of the method being executed; since methods can be
inherited from superclasses, this might not be the same as the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> object in the frame. If the level refers
to an ordinary function rather than a method, returns nil.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getInvokee()</code></p>

<p>Retrieve the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">invokee</code> in the frame,
returning the value.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getSelf()</code></p>

<p>Retrieves the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> from the frame,
returning the value. If the level refers to an ordinary function rather
than a method, returns nil.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getTargetObj()</code></p>

<p>Retrieves the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">targetobj</code> from the
frame, returning the value. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">targetobj</code> is the
object on the left side of the “.” expression that invoked the method.
This is usually the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code>, but can
differ when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delegated</code> is used to invoke
another object’s method as though it belonged to the calling object. If
the level refers to an ordinary function rather than a method, returns
nil.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getTargetProp()</code></p>

<p>Retrieves the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">targetprop</code> from the
frame, returning the value. This is the property value on the right side
of the “.” expression that invoked the method. If the level refers to an
ordinary function rather than a method, returns nil.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getVars()</code></p>

<p>Returns a LookupTable containing all of the local variables in the
frame. The table is keyed by variable name (each name is given as a
single-quoted string), and each associated value is the value of the
variable.</p>

<p>The values in the lookup table are snapshot copies of the variable
values, as they were at the time you called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getVars()</code>. The values in the table are <strong>not</strong>
updated when the actual local variable values change.</p>

<p>A new LookupTable is constructed each time this routine is called, based
on the variable values at the time of the call.</p>

<p>There are two main uses for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getVars()</code>. First,
it lets you enumerate all of the locals in the frame (using the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forEach()</code> method on the table), or get a list
of their names (using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keysToList()</code>). Second,
it lets you get a fixed snapshot copy of the locals, in case you want
the values at a particular point in time.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isActive()</code></p>

<p>Determines if the frame is still active. Returns
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> if so, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> if
not. A frame is active as long as the function or method call it
represents has not returned to its caller; once the routine returns to
its caller, the system automatically deletes the associated stack frame.
A frame does remain valid during the time it’s suspended waiting for a
routine it called to return.</p>

<p>Note that you don’t have to worry about whether the frame is active or
not if all you want to do is access its local variables. When the actual
stack frame is destroyed, if a StackFrameDesc object exists, the system
automatically makes a snapshot copy of the frame’s local variables in
the StackFrameDesc, which then uses the snapshot copy whenever you
access the locals. This means that you can access the locals even after
the true stack frame has been deleted.</p>
