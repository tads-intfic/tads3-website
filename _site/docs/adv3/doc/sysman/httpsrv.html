<h1 id="httpserver">HTTPServer</h1>

<p>The HTTPServer intrinsic class implements an HTTP network server. HTTP
is the protocol that Web browsers use to communicate with Web sites, so
this class lets you write a TADS program that can be accessed via a Web
browser, which in turn lets you use a Web browser as the user interface
for your game. It also makes it possible to create a multi-user
applications with TADS, since the server is designed to handle multiple
simultaneous connections.</p>

<h2 id="headers-and-library-files">Headers and library files</h2>

<p>To use the HTTPServer class, you must <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\#include
\&lt;httpsrv.h\&gt;</code> in your program. In addition, we recommend that you
add the library file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tadsnet.t</code> to your build
(by adding it to your project .t3m file), since this file defines some
helper classes often used with HTTPServer.</p>

<h2 id="starting-a-server">Starting a server</h2>

<p>Setting up a Web server is easy: you simply create an HTTPServer object,
specifying the network address that clients use to connect. Once you
create the HTTPServer object, it runs autonomously, handling network
connections in the background while your program runs.</p>

<p>The constructor looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local server = new HTTPServer(hostname, port, uploadLimit);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <em>hostname</em> argument gives the network address of the server. This is
the address on which the server will accept incoming connections, so
it’s the address that clients will use to connect to the server. The
<em>port</em> is an optional integer value giving the port number where the
server will listen for connections. <em>port</em> can be omitted entirely, or
given as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, which means that you want the
operating system to select a port number for you. We’ll go into more
detail on the host name and port number below.</p>

<p><em>uploadLimit</em> is an optional size limit, in bytes, for each uploaded
request body. If this is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or is omitted,
there’s no size limit. Some HTTP requests can include uploaded content;
for example, a POST request includes a message body that describes the
HTML form data being posted, and can also include uploaded file
attachments. The protocol itself doesn’t have any limit to these
uploaded messages, so if you don’t set a limit via this argument, the
client will be able to upload arbitrarily large objects. Uploads consume
memory and disk space on the server, so it’s a good idea to set a size
limit when possible, to prevent errant or malicious clients from
overwhelming the server with very large uploads.</p>

<p>If the server is started successfully, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code>
operator returns a new HTTPServer object representing the server. If an
error occurs, it throws a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NetException</code> error.</p>

<h3 id="selecting-the-address-and-port-number">Selecting the address and port number</h3>

<p>The host name and port number determine the network address where your
server will accept connections.</p>

<p>For the standard TADS Web UI setup, simply use
<a href="tadsnet.html#getLaunchHostAddr"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getLaunchHostAddr()</code></a>
as the host name and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> as the port number.
This creates a listener on a free port on the same address that the
client used to connect to the external Web server that launched the
program, or simply on “localhost” if the user launched the program
locally as a stand-alone application. We know that this address is
reachable from the client because the client had to connect to it to
trigger the program launch in the first place.</p>

<p>If you’re creating some other kind of application rather than using the
TADS Web UI conventions, you might have reasons to choose some other
host address and port number.</p>

<p>The host name can be given either as the human-readable name for the
computer, or as a decimal IP address, in the form ‘1.2.3.4’. The host
name for the server must always be a name or address that’s associated
with the <em>same machine</em> where the program is running: in other words,
you can’t run the program on one machine and start the server on another
machine just by entering the other machine’s address. The name or
address must also <em>already</em> be configured in the operating system: you
can’t create new host names for the computer just by starting a server
on an invented name.</p>

<p>Given all these restrictions, it might seem redundant to make you
specify the host name. After all, if you can only use an existing,
pre-configured name, why can’t the system just look up that
pre-configured name for you? The reason is that there might be more than
one valid host name and address. The host address isn’t actually
associated with the computer itself; it’s associated with a network
adapter, which is the hardware that physically connects the computer to
the network. Most modern computers can handle multiple network adapters
at once; each adapter has its own network address, so a computer with
multiple adapters attached will have multiple network addresses. So the
reason that HTTPServer makes you specify the host address is that doing
so gives you control over which address to use when multiple adapters
are present.</p>

<p>There are three main ways of selecting a custom host address:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can use the default name or IP address for the computer, as
configured in the operating system. This is the most common case,
because most computers only have one network address, meaning there’s
only the one address to choose from anyway. You can get the default
host name with the
<a href="tadsnet.html#getHostName"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getHostName()</code></a>
function. You can also get the default IP address with the
<a href="tadsnet.html#getHostName"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getLocalIP()</code></a>
function.</li>
  <li>In some cases, you’ll only want the program to accept <em>local</em>
connections - that is, clients running on the same machine. You might
want to do this for testing purposes, or if you’re setting up the
program as a local service only and you don’t want external clients to
connect for security reasons. In this case, you can use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'localhost'</code>
as the host name. The only connections possible will be from the local
machine, connecting to the address “http://localhost:<em>port</em>/”.</li>
  <li>If you’re running your program on a big network server that has
multiple network adapters, you might actually want to run a separate
server on each adapter, or at least choose the suitable adapter for
this particular server. In this case, you’ll want to manually
configure your program. One way of doing this is to specifically write
the program for a particular host, in which case you’d just hard-code
the host name right into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new
HTTPServer()</code> call. More likely, though, you’d set up the
program to get the host name from some external source, such as the
command-line parameters or an external configuration file. This
scenario is only for sophisticated users, obviously, so we’ll assume
you can figure it out on your own if this applies to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>The port number is how the networking system tells apart different
servers running on the same computer. Each server has its own port
number: a given port can only be used by only one server at a time.</p>

<p>From the client’s perspective, the port number is part of the HTTP URL.
For example, to connect to port 9155 on IP address 1.2.3.4, you’d enter
the URL “http://1.2.3.4:9155/”. You probably haven’t that “:port”
portion very often in everyday Web browsing, because most ordinary Web
servers run on the standard HTTP port, port 80. When you don’t include a
“:port” element in the address, the browser simply assumes “:80” by
default.</p>

<p>There are two ways to select a port number. One is to use a “well known”
port. With this approach, you select the port number in advance, when
you write your program, choosing a number in the range 0 to 1023. You
can then tell users that to connect to your server, they will always use
that number you select. The difficulty of this approach is that a given
port number can only be used by one server at a time on a given machine,
so if you choose a port that some other program happens to be using, one
or the other program won’t be able to use the port. You can reduce the
chances of this by consulting a list of commonly used ports (for
example, see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">Wikipedia
list</a>)
and choosing an unused port - but there’s still no guarantee, because
these lists obviously only include prominent, widely-used software.</p>

<p>The other approach is to let the operating system assign an available
port, by specifying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> as the <em>port</em>
parameter. This guarantees that you’ll get a port, because the OS will
always choose an available port. The complication is that the port
number will be different each time you run your program, because the OS
assigns port numbers arbitrarily. This means that you can’t just tell
your users in advance which port to use: you’ll need some way to
communicate the port number to users each time you run the server
program.</p>

<h3 id="handling-server-requests">Handling server requests</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTPServer</code> object handles all of the
low-level networking details automatically for you, running in separate
background threads. However, your program has full control over the
high-level services provided by the server. This means that it’s up to
you to respond to each client request.</p>

<p>HTTP is a simple protocol in which clients connect to the server and
send requests; the server answers each request with a reply. Each
request/reply pair is essentially a stand-alone unit of conversation.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTPServer</code> object handles each incoming
request by creating an
<a href="httpreq.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTPRequest</code></a> object, and placing
this in the network event queue. Your program receives these by calling
the <a href="tadsnet.html#getNetEvent">getNetEvent()</a> function, which waits for
and returns the next network event. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTPRequest</code> object provides methods that let
you retrieve the request information and send the reply. The basic
structure of a TADS program that serves HTTP requests is as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    #include &lt;tads.h&gt;
    #include &lt;tadsnet.h&gt;
    #include &lt;httpsrv.h&gt;
    #include &lt;httpreq.h&gt;

    main(args)
    {
        // start the server
        local server = new HTTPServer(getLocalIP(), nil);
        "HTTP Server listening on port &lt;&lt;server.getPortNum()&gt;&gt;\n";

        // process requests
        for (;;)
        {
            local evt = getNetEvent();
            if (evt.evType == NetEvRequest &amp;&amp; evt.evRequest.ofKind(HTTPRequest))
            {
                // send the reply
                evt.evRequest.sendReply('It worked! You asked for &lt;&lt;
                   evt.evRequest.getQuery()&gt;&gt;.', 'text/plain', 200);
            }
        }

        // shut down the server
        server.shutdown();
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is obviously missing a few things you’d want in a real server (it
doesn’t have any error handling, for example), but it will actually work
as written. You can type it in and run it, and it’ll serve pages to your
browser. To expand this into a real server, you’d add code to inspect
the request parameters to determine what the client is asking for,
process the request accordingly, and send a suitable reply. You’d also
want to add some error handling so that the server doesn’t abort at the
first lost network connection. (HTTP is by design a stateless protocol,
so dropped connections are common, and shouldn’t faze a server.)</p>

<p>As you can see, the design makes it quite easy to write the skeleton of
a server, while providing you with essentially unlimited flexibility.
The TADS infrastructure doesn’t make any assumptions about what the
client will request or what the reply will look like - that’s all up to
you.</p>

<h2 id="httpserver-methods">HTTPServer methods</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getAddress()</code></p>

<p>Returns a string giving the original binding address specified when the
object was constructed. This is the address on which the server is
listening for incoming connection requests from clients. This returns
the same format originally specified in the constructor, which can be
either a host name or a numeric IP address. Returns
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> if no address is available.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getIPAddress()</code></p>

<p>Returns a string giving the numeric IP address on which the server is
listening for connections. This is in the usual decimal format, as in
‘127.0.0.1’. Returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> if no address is
available.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getPortNum()</code></p>

<p>Returns an integer giving the port number on which the server is
listening.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shutdown(*wait*?)</code></p>

<p>Shuts down the server. This closes the network port on which the server
listens for connections, terminates the listener thread, and terminates
any session threads that the server launched.</p>

<p>If <em>wait</em> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>, the method doesn’t return
until all of the server threads have exited. This ensures that you can
immediately reuse the server’s port number with a new server object. If
you omit <em>wait</em> specify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, the method
signals the server to shut down, but then returns immediately, allowing
the the server to carry out its termination in the background. You can
use this option if you won’t need to reuse the port number.</p>

<p>Calling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shutdown()</code> method is optional. If
your program simply exits, the system will automatically shut down any
servers that are still active.</p>

<h2 id="save-restore-undo">Save, restore, undo</h2>

<p>HTTPServer objects are inherently <a href="objdef.html#transient">transient</a>.
This is because they’re associated with live operating system resources
(threads and network sockets) that can’t be saved in a file. This means
that any object properties that refer to HTTPServer objects will be
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> when you restore a previously saved
session. Also, HTTPServer objects are not affected by Undo operations.</p>

<h2 id="automatic-shutdown">Automatic shutdown</h2>

<p>HTTPServer objects work like any others with respect to garbage
collection: if an HTTPServer object becomes unreachable, the system will
delete it during the next garbage collection pass. When this happens,
the object automatically shuts down the listener and any session threads
started by the server. This means that you have to ensure that each
HTTPServer instance remains reachable for as long as you want the server
to continue running. You can accomplish this by storing a reference to
the HTTPServer object in a named object’s property, for example.</p>

<p>If the server has posted any requests to the network event queue, and
the garbage collector deletes the server object after those events have
been posted but before you retrieve them via
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getNetEvent()</code>, the events will <em>not</em> be
deleted from the queue - they’ll be returned as normal from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getNetEvent()</code>. If you use the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getServer()</code> method on one of these request
objects, it will return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, since the server
object no longer exists. If you send a response to the request, it will
fail with a network exception.</p>

<h2 id="network-safety-levels">Network safety levels</h2>

<p>The VM enforces a user-specified security setting called the “network
safety level”. The user interface for setting the level varies by
interpreter; for command-line interpreters, for example, it’s controlled
by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-ns</code> option when starting the program.</p>

<p>The HTTPServer class is subject to the “server” component of the network
safety level. The VM enforces the safety level when you attempt to
create an HTTPServer object with operator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code>.
If the safety level doesn’t allow the type of server you’re trying to
create, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> operator throws a
NetSafetyException instead of creating the HTTPServer object.</p>

<p>When the server component of the net safety level is set to 0 (“minimum
safety”), network access is unrestricted. When the safety level is 1, an
HTTPServer can only be created if the host name is “localhost” or
“127.0.0.1”; in other words, the server can only be created with local
access, from applications on the same machine only. Higher safety levels
prohibit creating an HTTPServer at all.</p>
