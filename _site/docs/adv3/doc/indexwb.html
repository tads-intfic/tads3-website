<p><a href="T3QuickStart.html" class="title">TADS 3 Quick Start
Guide</a><br />
by Eric Eve</p>

<p>This brief guide is probably the best place to start for newcomers to
TADS 3. It contains instructions for installing the system and compiling
a basic game, an explanation of the other documentation, including
guidance on where to go next, and a sample game newcomers can experiment
with if they want to dive straight it.</p>

<p><a href="gsg/index.html" class="title">Getting Started in TADS 3</a><br />
by Eric Eve</p>

<p>This tutorial introduction is a great starting point for anyone new to
TADS 3 and new to programming. The book opens with the basics of getting
TADS working on your system and setting up your first simple game, so
even if you’ve never done any programming before, this will help you get
going quickly. The tutorial then leads you step by step through the
design of a full-scale example game, showing how to use TADS to
implement the effects needed in the game. By the time you’re done,
you’ll know your way around the system and you’ll be able to write your
own games.</p>

<p><em>This book is accompanied by a sample game,</em> The Further Adventures of
Heidi<em>. The game’s source files can be found
here:</em><a href="gsg/Heidi.t"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Heidi.t</code></a> <a href="gsg/Heidi.t3m"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Heidi.t3m</code></a></p>

<p><em>This book can also be viewed in a <a href="gsg/Getting%20Started%20in%20TADS%203.pdf">PDF
version</a>. This version is
recommended if you want to make a printed copy.</em></p>

<p>Part tutorial and part reference, <em>Learning TADS 3</em> is a perfect place
to start for confident beginners, and for people with a little more
programming experience. This book is designed for learning TADS on your
terms - it’s organized by functional area, so once you’ve mastered the
basics, you can skip around to focus on the areas you’re most interested
in. As you develop your game, you can return to the book as a reference,
to review the details of particular TADS features.</p>

<p><a href="htmltads/intro.html" class="title">Introduction to HTML TADS</a><br />
by Michael Roberts</p>

<p>TADS 3 uses a variant of HTML as its formatting language. These notes
explain how HTML fits into TADS, and how you can use HTML formatting
codes for text effects, graphics, and sound, and how the TADS variant
differs from standard HTML. (These are essentially just the original
notes for HTML TADS 2, so they’re a little rough, but they are updated
with relevant changes for TADS 3. Note that this isn’t an HTML
tutorial - but the HTML in TADS is pretty close to standard HTML, so you
can learn it from any of the many tutorials on the Web for ordinary
HTML.)</p>
