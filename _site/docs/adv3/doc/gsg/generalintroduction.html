<h1 id="chapter-1---introduction">Chapter 1 - Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="general-introduction">General Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are reading this Beginner’s Guide to using TADS 3 you will
presumably already know what Interactive Fiction is, so I shall not
offer an explanation here. You will presumably already have found your
way to Mike Roberts’s TADS pages
(<a href="%20http://www.tads.org" target="_top">http://www.tads.org</a>),
will probably have downloaded the TADS 3 author’s kit and tried it out,
and may perhaps have some familiarity with another IF language such as
TADS 2 or Inform. If you are still trying to work out how to install the
TADS 3 compiler or do anything with it, the instructions in the section
on “<a href="creatingyourfirsttads3project.html">Creating your First TADS 3
Project</a>” below should get you
started. On the other hand, if you have already got going in TADS 3 you
can skip the remaining sections of this chapter and maybe the next
chapter as well. I shall not in any case spend a great deal of time
explaining programming concepts such as functions, operators,
statements, classes and objects, but the final two sections of this
chapter provide a basic introduction to the way these are implemented in
TADS 3 and to the programming concepts needed to follow this guide
<a href="chapter2.html">Chapter Two</a> then shows you how to implement a very short
sample game; for some readers this may be the best place to start.</p>

<p>The approach taken in the remainder of this guide will be to introduce
various features of TADS 3 through developing a more substantial game.
Inform 6 users will recognize the genesis of this game in the <em>Inform
Beginner’s Guide</em> by Roger Firth and Sonja Kesserich (who have very
kindly allowed me to borrow both Heidi and her forest), although rather
than following the <em>IBG’s</em> route of illustrating features of the
language through three successive games, I shall stick with the same
game, <em>The Further Adventures of Heidi</em>, and increase its complexity
from chapter to chapter. The complete source code of the finished game,
heidi.t, should be packaged in the zip file with this guide (if you
downloaded it separately) or with the TADS 3 documentation set.</p>

<p><a href="startinganewgame.html">Chapter Three</a> will explain in some detail how to
define a room and a single object within that room for the game we’ll be
developing together throughout the remainder of the guide. Things will
become rather more complicated in <a href="basictravel.html">Chapter Four</a> when
we look at the use of various kinds of connector to move between rooms,
and at the same time introduce a number of other features of the TADS 3
library and language so we can program a couple of basic puzzles (how to
get to the top of a tree and find a diamond ring in a bird’s nest). The
main focus of <a href="settingthescene.html">Chapter Five</a> will be the
programming of an NPC (non-player character), in this case a friendly
charcoal-burner who turns out to be the owner of the missing ring.
Subsequent chapters will place a further series of obstacles between
Heidi and the ring so that we can sample the excitements of lockable
doors, dark caves, and a pair of conveniently buried Wellington boots
(to mention a few) and thereby introduce a number of other features. By
<a href="lettherebelight.html">Chapter Seven</a> we shall be sending Heidi on a boat
trip down to the shops (well, a shop), and trying to figure out how to
handle buying and selling. <a href="fillinginsomegaps.html">Chapter Eight</a> will
wrap things up with some suggestions on how to put some finishing
touches to the game, a look at a different ways we could have tackled a
couple of the problems we encountered, some suggestions on how to make
testing and debugging slightly less painful, and some pointers on where
to go next. Needless to say, the sample game won’t be able to cover all
the features of TADS 3, neither will it lay out the ones it does touch
in a particularly systematic fashion; but it will introduce you to the
process of writing Interactive Fiction in TADS 3 and in process of doing
so it will introduce you to many of the features of the system you are
likely to use in your own games.</p>

<p>It follows that this <em>Beginner’s Guide</em> is not really intended for
bedtime reading (although it may turn out to be an excellent cure for
insomnia!); it is intended rather to be used sitting at your computer
while you type the example code and see how it works when you compile
it, and, even better, try experimenting and implementing things for
yourself when invited to do so. If you’d like a sneak preview of where
it’s all going, by all means compile the heidi.t file that should have
come with this <em>Guide</em> and play through the game - just don’t expect it
to be a masterpiece of IF!</p>

<p>This is by no means a formal manual, but I shall employ a few
typographical conventions. Text in the normal font (like this) will be
used for the bulk of the text. Text in <strong>bold</strong> will generally represent
what a player might type at the TADS 3 command prompt when playing a
game (e.g. <strong>north</strong> or <strong>eat the baked banana</strong>). Text in the
fixed-spaced font (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">like this</code>) will be used for code or fragments of
code (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name = 'Fred'</code> ).</p>

<p>Note that both the <em>Guide</em> and the heidi.t file have been written to be
compatible with TADS 3.1.0 (although most things will probably work well
enough with earlier versions). If you have an earlier version of TADS 3
installed, please update it to the latest version before following the
instructions in this guide, otherwise you may keep coming across things
that do not work as they are described (as well as finding you get a
raft of errors when you try to compile heidi.t). If by the time you read
this you have a version of TADS later than 3.1.0, please check the
revision history notes that come with it in case there are any changes
that you need to implement to the code in heidi.t, and the code given in
the remainder of this Guide to get things to work.</p>

<p>Exactly how you approach this <em>Getting Started Guide</em> may depend both on
your temperament and your previous experience (either with other systems
for writing Interactive Fiction or with programming in general). If you
feel you want a reasonably sound grasp of the findamentals of the TADS 3
language before seeing how to write a game in it, then you’ll probably
want to read the remainder of this chapter. If, on the other hand, you’d
rather get straight on with the business of seeing how a game is
written, you might prefer to skip straight to Chapter Two and only
return to the last two sections of this chapter if and when you feel the
need to clarify the programming concepts employed in the course of this
guide. If you’d prefer a compromise solution, you could read the
“<a href="programmingprolegomena.html">Programming Prolegomena</a>” section below,
but leave the final “<a href="furtherprogramming.html">Further Programming Concepts and
Constructs</a>” section till later. But whatever
you do, please try to master the basics fully before trying to do
something more complex; some new users of TADS 3 become frustrated
because they try to run before they have learned how to walk.</p>

<p>Finally, do feel free to experiment as you work your way through the
material that follows; you will almost certainly learn more if you try
adapting the example code given to try things out than if you simply
copy it all with your brain in neutral. It may often, however, be a good
idea to clean out your experimental code before going on to the next
step in this <em>Guide</em>, just in case your bright ideas clash with mine,
and if you find your experiments are leading to frustration and
confusion you may want to postpone them for a while.</p>
