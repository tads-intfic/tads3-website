<h2 id="t3-vm-metaclasses">T3 VM Metaclasses</h2>

<p>The T3 VM design specifies several metaclasses that will be present in
most implementations of the VM. The metaclass system is modular, so
these metaclasses are not special in any way, except that they’re
specifically described in this VM specification. A particular
implementation may choose not to include any of these metaclasses, or
may include only a subset. However, because of their general utility, we
expect that most VM implementations will include most or all of these
metaclasses.</p>

<h3 id="the-tads-object-metaclass">The “TADS Object” Metaclass</h3>

<p>The “TADS object” metaclass implements what the TADS language programmer
thinks of as an object. This type of object stores a list of base
classes, and a list of property/value pairs. The property list is
mutable throughout the object’s lifetime; the values of existing
properties can be altered, and new properties can be added. Properties
cannot be deleted, however.</p>

<p>We have several goals in implementing the TADS object metaclass. First,
property access should be fast, since getting the value of a property is
a very common operation. Second, setting the value of a property should
be fast. Third, because an object can have many properties, it would be
desirable to be able to save an object’s state at run-time by saving
only the changes made to the load image; objects can have quite large
load images, so we could save substantial space in saved state files by
storing only the changes between the dynamic state and the initial load
image.</p>

<p>The object extension of a TADS object contains a header, the superclass
list, the load image property list, and the changed property list. The
header contains the number of superclasses, the number of properties in
the load image list, the number of properties in the changed list, and
the number of allocated property slots. The superclass list, load image
property list, and altered property list are kept in memory in portable
byte format, to allow very rapid reading and writing of the information.</p>

<p>The load image property list contains the <em>original</em> property list from
the load image, if any. This list is never altered throughout the
object’s lifetime. We keep the load image property list sorted in
ascending order of property ID. We require the compiler to sort the
property list when creating the load image; we simply assume the list is
in sorted order when loaded. Since this list never changes, we do not
incur any overhead keeping the list in sorted order.</p>

<p>The modifiable property list is an array of properties that have been
changed since the object was loaded. This list is not kept in sorted
order; although sorting the list would allow faster access, it would
create substantial overhead when setting property values, because it
would be necessary to reorder the list to accomodate each insertion.</p>

<p>To find a property, we first scan the modifiable property list. If the
property is found in this list, this value is returned; otherwise, we
look in the load image list. The load image list is sorted, so we can
perform a binary search of this list.</p>

<p><strong>Saving and restoring state:</strong> To save state, we save only the changed
property list. The load image property list never changes, so we do not
need to save this in a saved state file. To restore state, we discard
the entire current changed property list, and load the changed property
list from the saved state file.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic construction from stack arguments:</strong> The stack contains one or
more arguments. The first argument is the superclass object; if this
value is nil, the object has no superclass. The object is initialized
with the given superclass and no property values. Then, the object’s
“construct” method is invoked, passing all additional arguments as
parameters to the “construct” method.</p>

<p><strong>Garbage collection:</strong> Note that we never have to mark as referenced
any objects referenced from the load image property list. This list is
always identical to the list in the load image, so must by its nature
refer only to objects in the root set, which are always reachable and
thus never need to be explicitly marked as such during garbage
collection. Hence, we only need to mark the objects in the changed
property list.</p>

<p><strong>Inheritance:</strong> TADS Objects can inherit from other TADS objects. A
TADS object that inherits from another TADS object is said to be a
subclass of the second object, or to be derived from the second object.
If a TADS object inherits from another TADS object, it implicitly
defines all of the properties defined by the second object, and has the
same value for each property in the second object that doesn’t also
appear in the first object. Any properties defined in the subclass
object override the same properties in the subclass.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we have two objects, A and B, with B defined as
inheriting from A. Suppose also that A defines the properties P and Q
(i.e., A’s property table contains entries for the property ID’s of
properties P and Q), and that B defines the properties Q and R.</p>

<p>Inheritance is implemented as a search up the superclass tree. When we
want to get a property of an object, we start with the object’s property
table; if the property is defined in the object’s property table, the
value from that definition is used. Otherwise, we start with the first
superclass in the list of superclasses (the order in the table is
significant, in that it defines the search order). For each superclass,
we recursively try to get the property from the superclass; if it’s
found, we note the value and the actual object that supplied the value
(because the superclass may in turn inherit the value from one of its
superclasses, the value may not come directly from the superclass). In
general, if the same property is found in two superclasses, the one that
came earlier in the list takes precedence over the one that came later.
However, there is a complex situation where this is not the case: if the
two superclasses share a common base class, and the first superclass
inherits the property from the common base class, and the second
superclass overrides the property inherited from the common base class,
then we use the value from the <em>second</em> superclass, because the value
from the second superclass is more specific than one from the first.</p>

<p>To illustrate, consider the following class tree:</p>

<p>    Base defines properties P, Q, R<br />
    A inherits from Base, defines Q<br />
    B inherits from Base, defines R<br />
    C inherits from A, B, defines P</p>

<ul>
  <li>If we get property P from C, then we retrieve the value C.P, because
the property is defined directly in C.</li>
  <li>If we get property Q from C, we find that C does not have this
property in its table, so we must look at superclasses. We start with
A, and find that Q is defined in this property table. We continue to
superclass B; we do not find Q here, but we <em>do</em> find it in B’s
superclass Base. However, since Base does not derive from A, where we
originally found the property, we ignore this, and return A.Q.</li>
  <li>If we get property R from C, we again find that C does not have the
property in its table, so we look at superclasses. We start with A; we
find that R is not in its table, so we look at its superclass Base,
where we find the property. So, we note Base.R and continue looking.
We look next at superclass B, where we find R defined. Now, since B
derives from Base, where we originally found R, this value overrides
the original value we found, so we use this value. Since we have no
further superclasses to look at, we return B.R.</li>
</ul>

<p>Inheritance comes into play in two separate cases. In the first case, we
are searching for a given method of a given object; the search order is
as described above. In the second case, we are explicitly inheriting
from a currently executing method; in this case, the search occurs
exactly as in the first case, except that we pretend that the currently
executing method did not exist, so we continue the same inheritance
search to determine what would come next in the search order if the
executing method were not defined. To support this second case, each
executing method maintains in its activation frame all of the
information needed to continue a previous search: the original target
object (so that we can go back to the exact same starting point in the
inheritance search that we used to find the executing method in the firs
tplace), and the current defining object (which is the point we must
reach, and then pass, to find the next object in the search order).</p>

<h4 id="image-file-data">Image File Data</h4>

<p>The image file data for an object of metaclass TADS-Object is arranged
as follows:</p>

<p>Generic Metaclass Header</p>

<p>UINT2 superclass count</p>

<p>UINT2 load image property count</p>

<p>UINT2 object flags</p>

<p>UINT4 superclass 1 object ID<br />
…<br />
UINT 4 superclass <em>N</em> object ID</p>

<p>Property value 1<br />
…<br />
Property value <em>N</em></p>

<p>Each property value is arranged as follows:</p>

<p>UINT2 property ID</p>

<p>DATAHOLDER property value</p>

<p>The property table is arranged in order of ascending property ID, with
the property ID values ordered as unsigned 16-bit integers. The sorted
order is required so that VM implementations can use a binary search or
other algorithm that depends upon the table being pre-sorted.</p>

<p>The superclass table is arranged in order of definition of the
superclasses, so the first superclass of an object is first in the
table; this ordering determines the search order for inherited
properties, in that we search the first superclass in the list first.</p>

<p>The “object flags” value is a set of bit-field flags stored as a
portable UINT2 value. The valid flag values are shown below. All other
bits in the value should be set to zero, to ensure compatibility with
any future versions that define additional flag values.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x0001</code></p>

<p>The object represents a class, not an instance.</p>

<hr />

<p><span id="string"></span></p>

<h3 id="the-string-metaclass">The “String” Metaclass</h3>

<p>Dynamically-constructed strings are represented as objects of metaclass
<strong>String</strong>. Because the same operations that are possible on dynamic
strings are also possible on constant strings, and because a constant
string has no associated object, the methods implemented in the String
metaclass are all accessible to the byte-code interpreter through static
methods that take a constant string’s byte array pointer as an argument.
The metaclass member functions can all be implemented as calls to the
corresponding static methods with the instance’s string byte array as an
argument.</p>

<p>The variable-size object extension for a String object contains a
two-byte length prefix, followed by the bytes of the string. The length
prefix gives the length of the string in bytes, not counting the length
prefix bytes themselves.</p>

<p>A String object always has a constant text string associated with it,
even though the String object itself was dynamically constructed. In
other words, an operation such as concatenation applied to a String
object does <em>not</em> affect the String object itself, but instead creates a
new String object containing the result of the operation. This is
important, because it means that a given String object never changes, so
an operation on a String object will not affect any other references to
the same String object. Consider the following TADS code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    s1 = 'hello there'.substr(1, 5);
    s2 = s1;
    s1 += '!!!';
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first line creates a dynamic string containing the text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'hello'</code>
and assigns a reference to the dynamic string to the local variable
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s1</code>. The second line assigns a reference to the same string to the
local variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s2</code>. The third line changes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s1</code> by appending the text
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'!!!'</code>. This does <em>not</em> change the underlying String object to which
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s2</code> refer just before this statement, but instead creates a
new String object that contains the result of the concatenation, and
assigns a reference to the new object to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s1</code>. After the concatenation,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s2</code> still refers to the original String object, which still constains
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'hello'</code>.</p>

<p>The String metaclass performs the following operations for the generic
object interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get property value. The String metaclass implements several methods
through the get-property mechanism, to provide access to these
operations to user code or built-in function implementations. Methods
include “substring”, to extract a substring of the string; “upper
case” and “lower case”, to convert the case of the string; “search”,
to find a substring within the string.</li>
  <li>Add. The argument (the right operand of the “+” operator) must be a
string constant or an object or metaclass String. Retrieves the byte
string from the argument, appends it to the byte string of this
object, and create and returns a new object of metaclass String
containing the concatenation.</li>
  <li>Index. Retrieves the character at the given character position,
returning a primitive Integer value giving the character code.</li>
  <li>Assign to index. This takes an integer index value and an integer
value or a string constant or String object value. This sets the
character at the given character position to the given new value (in
the case of an integer value, the integer is interpreted as a
character value; in the case of a string constant or object, the first
character of the string is used), creating and returning a new object
reflecting the substituted character. Note that this does <em>not</em> change
the text of the string stored in this object, since a String object’s
text value is immutable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dynamic construction from stack arguments:</strong> Strings cannot currently
be constructed dynamically using the NEW instruction. (There’d be little
point in constructing a new string from an existing string, since it
would just be an unnecessary copy of the same string. It may be
desirable to add some form of this in the future, though, perhaps for
certain types of type conversions.)</p>

<hr />

<p><span id="list"></span></p>

<h3 id="the-list-metaclass">The “List” Metaclass</h3>

<p>Dynamically-constructed lists are represented as objects of metaclass
<strong>List</strong>. Because the same operations that can be performed on List
objects can also be performed on constant lists, and because a constant
list has no associated object, the methods implemented in the List
metaclass are all accessible to the byte-code interpreter through static
methods that take a constant list’s byte array pointer as an argument.
The metaclass member functions can all be implemented as calls to the
corresponding statis methods with the instance’s byte array as an
argument.</p>

<p>A List object’s variable-size extension contains a two-byte element
count, followed by the elements of the list. The elements are stored as
a packed array of value holders.</p>

<p>As with String objects, a List object’s value is immutable, even though
the object itself was dynamically constructed. So, an operation on a
list that yields a different value for the list also yields a new List
object, rather than changing the original List object’s data. This means
that a given List object never changes, so an operation on a List object
will not affect any other references to the same List object. Consider
the following TADS code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    s1 = ['x' 'y'] + 'z';
    s2 = s1;
    s1[1] = 'w';
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first line creates a dynamic list containing the list
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">['x' 'y' 'z']</code>, and assigns a reference to the object to the local
variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s1</code>. The second line assigns a reference to the same object to
the local variable<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s2</code>. The third line changes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s1</code> by assigning the
string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'w'</code> to the first element of its list. This does <em>not</em> change
the underlying List object to which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s2</code> refer just before this
statement, but instead creates a new List object that contains the
result of the index assignment, and assigns a reference to the new
object to the original List object, which still contains the original
list <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">['x' 'y' 'z']</code>.</p>

<p>The List metaclass performs the following operations for the generic
object interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enumerate references. Calls the enumerator callback function for each
element of the list that is an object. Note that this method does
<em>not</em> need to be implemented for constant lists, because a constant
list can only refer to objects that are part of the root set and are
thus inherently reachable at all times.</li>
  <li>Add. Appends the value of the argument (the right operand of the “+”
operator) to the end of the list. If the argument is of primitive type
Integer, Float, Object ID for an object of any metaclass other than
List, Property ID, or String constant, this simply adds the value of
the argument as a new element. If the argument. If the argument is a
List object or list constant, this adds the elements of the list to
the end of this list; in other words, concatenating two lists creates
a new list whose number of elements is the sum of the numbers of
elements of the two original lists. This behavior is different than
for other types, in that the argument list is <em>not</em> added to the
original list as a sublist at the last element, but rather the
argument list’s elements are each added one by one to the original
list.</li>
  <li>Index. Retrieves the list element at the given index value.</li>
  <li>Assign to index. Creates a new list that contains the original list
with the element at the given index replaced by the given new value.
This does <em>not</em> change the original list, but rather creates a new
list with the value replaced.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dynamic construction from stack arguments:</strong> Constructing a list from
stack arguments results in a list that contains each of the arguments,
in the same order in which they appear on the stack (the first item
popped becomes the first element of the list, and so on, so the list
elements should be pushed in the reverse of the order that they should
have in the resulting list). Constructing a list with zero arguments
creates an empty list.</p>

<hr />

<p><span id="vector"></span></p>

<h3 id="the-vector-metaclass">The “Vector” Metaclass</h3>

<p>In addition to the List metaclass, the VM provides a Vector metaclass.
This metaclass behaves very similarly to the List metaclass, with a few
important distinctions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A vector’s contents are mutable. Assigning a new value to an element
of a vector does <em>not</em> create a new Vector object, but rather changes
the contents of original Vector object.</li>
  <li>There is no such thing as a constant vector. The only way that a
vector can be constructed is by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new Vector</code> operator.
However, a vector can be constructed based on a list (either a list
constant or a List object) by passing the list as the argument to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new Vector</code> operator. Alternatively, a vector can be constructed
simply by specifying the initial allocation size of the Vector as the
argument to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new Vector</code> operator.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first point is important because it means that, if there are several
references to a vector, changing a vector’s contents through one
reference will also change the vector visible to the other references.
This is not true of lists. Consider this TADS code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    s1 = new Vector(10);
    for (i = 1 ; i &lt; 10 ; ++i)
        s1.append(i);
    s2 = s1;
    s1[5] = 100;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code first creates a vector with ten elements and assigns it to the
local variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s1</code>. Next, the code initializes the vector by storing a
number in each element equal to the element’s index. Next, the code
assigns a reference to the same vector to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s2</code>. Finally, the code
assigns the number 100 to element 5 of the vector in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s1</code>. After this
final line, the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s1[5]</code> is 100; in addition, the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s2[5]</code> is also 100. Since both variables refer to the same vector
object, and the underlying object is changed by the assignment, both
variables see the change. The Vector metaclass performs the following
operations for the methods in the generic object interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enumerate references. Calls the enumerator callback function for each
element of the vector that is an object.</li>
  <li>Index. Retrieves the list element at the given index value.</li>
  <li>Assign to index. Creates a new list that contains the original list
with the element at the given index replaced by the given new value.
This does <em>not</em> change the original list, but rather creates a new
list with the value replaced.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><span id="lookup"></span></p>

<h3 id="the-lookuptable-metaclass">The “LookupTable” Metaclass</h3>

<p>The T3 VM provides a “lookup table” metaclass that provides an efficient
mechanism for looking up objects by key value. While the same
functionality could be implemented from simpler objects in user code,
this native-code metaclass is provided for better performance.</p>

<p>LookupTable objects can be created explicitly by user code via the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new LookupTable</code> operator. Once created, a lookup table can be
populated using a set of method calls.</p>

<p>A lookup table contains a set of associations; each assocation relates a
key and an object. The table can be efficiently searched given a key to
yield a list of the objects associated with the key.</p>

<p>A key is simply a string value. The associated value can be any object.</p>

<p>The lookup table object extension stores a hash table. The hash table
starts with a count, giving the number of elements in the table, then an
array with the given number of elements. Each element of the array
consists of a value holder, which contains the key value for the entry,
or nil if there is no entry at that element. Separately, the table
stores a value holder for each value associated with each key.</p>

<p>Undo interaction: the lookup table metaclass must store undo information
for any changes it makes to the table structure. Each time a table entry
is changed, we must store an undo record reflecting the index of the
change, the original key value, and the original value. Because an undo
record can only contain a single value, we must record a change to the
key value and a change to the list value separately.</p>

<p>The WeakRefLookupTable metaclass is a subclass of LookupTable that works
the same way, except that it only stores weak references to the values
in the table.</p>
