<h2 id="t3-portable-binary-encoding">T3 Portable Binary Encoding</h2>

<p>All T3 binary files are encoded in a portable format that allows a
binary file created on one type of computer to be used without any
changes with T3 implementations on other types of computers. To achieve
this binary portability, T3 binary files use a portable encoding that
represents datatypes in a standard format. Each T3 implementation
translates between the standard format and the local representation of
the datatype when reading and writing files.</p>

<h3 id="datatypes">Datatypes</h3>

<p>The following are the portable datatypes and their encoding:</p>

<h4 id="utf-8-text">UTF-8 Text</h4>

<p>Unicode text is encoded in UTF-8. This encoding represents each 16-bit
Unicode character with one, two, or three bytes:</p>

<p>From</p>

<p>To</p>

<p>Binary Encoding</p>

<p>0x0000</p>

<p>0x007f</p>

<p>0bbbbbbb</p>

<p>0x0080</p>

<p>0x07ff</p>

<p>110bbbbb 10bbbbbb</p>

<p>0x0800</p>

<p>0xffff</p>

<p>1110bbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb</p>

<p>The bits of the 16-bit value are encoded into the <strong>b</strong>’s in the table
above with the most significant group of bits in the first byte. So:
0x571 has the 16-bit Unicode binary pattern 0000011001110001, and is
encoded in UTF-8 as 11011001 10110001.</p>

<p>Note that UTF-8 encodes the most significant bits in the first bytes;
this is different from the byte ordering used for other types (such as
integers), which are all stored in little-endian format
(least-significant byte first). The reason for this disparity is that
this ordering makes it possible to compare two UTF-8 strings in a
byte-wise fashion. (This type of magnitude comparison is not always
especially useful, since it does not produce correct results for a
localized sorting order, but it at least produces a uniform sorting
order based on the Unicode code points stored in the string and hence
may be useful in certain cases for building internal indices and
tables.)</p>

<h4 id="integer-values">Integer values</h4>

<p>Integer values are stored in little-endian format (i.e.,
least-significant byte first) in fixed-size byte arrays. These values
are not aligned on any particular boundary in the file. These values can
be interpreted as signed or unsigned. Signed values are encoded in
2’s-complement notation.</p>

<p><strong>16-bit integers</strong> are stored as 2-byte arrays. The first byte has the
low-order 8 bits, the second byte has the high-order 8 bits.</p>

<p><strong>32-bit integers</strong> are stored as 4-byte arrays. The first byte has the
low-order 8 bits, the second byte has the next more significant 8 bits,
the third byte has the next more significant 8 bits, and the fourth byte
has the most significant 8 bits.</p>

<h3 id="data-holders">Data Holders</h3>

<p>The T3 VM uses run-time typing, which allows certain types of variables
to hold any type of value; this type of value is tagged with its type,
so that the VM can interpret the value correctly whenever it is used.</p>

<p>In order to store these “variant” types, the VM defines a composite type
called a data holder. This composite contains the type information along
with the value.</p>

<p>To store a data holder portably, we store a 5-byte array. The first byte
contains the type ID value. The remaining 4 bytes encode the value using
the standard primitive type encodings; the table below shows the
correspondence between the primitive types and their encodings.</p>

<p>When an encoding does not take up the full 4 bytes, the value is packed
into the earlier bytes, and the later bytes have arbitrary values. For
example, a property ID is encoded in a data holder as follows:</p>

<p>Byte Index</p>

<p>Value</p>

<p>0</p>

<p>6 (the type code for VM_PROP)</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>low-order 8 bits of property ID value</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>high-order 8 bits of property ID value</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>arbitrary</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>arbitrary</p>

<h3 id="type-ids">Type ID’s</h3>

<p>The table below shows the assigned ID values for the primitive types.
(The types shown in italics are reserved for internal use by
implementations and will never appear in portable files; we list them
for the sake of completeness, but they’ll never be stored persistently
and thus are not relevant to the portable file format.)</p>

<p>17</p>

<p><em>Reserved for implementation use for an executable object, as a 32-bit

<p>Note that types 3 (VM_STACK), 4 (VM_CODEPTR), 14 (VM_NATIVE_CODE), and
17 (VM_OBJX) are reserved for implementation use. These will <strong>never</strong>
appear in a portable binary file; we list them here only for
completeness. These types are intended to allow implementations to store
native datatypes (such as native machine pointers) for which there is no
meaningful portable representation. Implementations are free to use
these types for any purposes of their own; the names and descriptions in
the table are for mnemonic value only and shouldn’t be taken to imply a
required use for these types.</p>

portable datatypes:</p>

<p>Name</p>

<p>Description</p>
