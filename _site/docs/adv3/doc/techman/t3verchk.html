<h1 id="verify-check-and-when-to-use-which">Verify, Check, and When to Use Which</h1>

<p><em>by Steve Breslin<br />
compiled from discussions on
<a href="news:rec.arts.int-fiction">rec.arts.int-fiction</a></em></p>

<p>The TADS 3 command execution model gets the command’s objects involved
in the execution process, via the dobjFor(verb) and iobjFor(verb) groups
of methods. Part of this process is to decide whether or not to allow
the command to proceed in the first place. The execution model offers
not just one but <em>two</em> distinct places for each object to make those
go/no-go decisions. One is the “verify” routine, and one is the “check”
routine.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> have the the same mandate, namely to
determine whether or not allow the command to proceed. But they’re not
interchangeable; there are definite differences in their effects. The
distinction between the two is a bit subtle, and at times it can be
confusing. This article aims to clarify exactly what each one is for,
and to help you develop a sense of when to use which one.</p>

<h2 id="strictly-speaking">Strictly speaking</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> stage of action processing is
designed to interrupt the action processing only when there’s a
“logical” problem with the command. Pouring a desk or eating a topic -
such actions would be illogical.</p>

<p>In contrast, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> stage is for commands
that <em>seem</em> logical enough, but nonetheless won’t work. In these cases,
the action still needs to be quashed, but not until after the parser has
decided which objects could logically be involved. For example, the
player tries to wear some jeans, but the jeans are too small. Maybe the
player tries to melt something with the match, but the match isn’t
producing enough heat. In such cases, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code>
can interrupt the action, and explain the failure.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-the-two-phases">So why the two phases?</h2>

<p>The benefit of having a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> stage separate
from the verify() step is not in making the verification stage purely
logic-oriented, nor in removing some of the conditional statements from
the action stage. Such cosmetic adjustments would hardly justify the
added complication of the check() stage.</p>

<p>The point of separating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> is that it lets the parser ask the
game if a command makes logical sense, <em>separately</em> from determining if
the command can actually be executed. It might seem difficult to
separate these two ideas, but the distinction isn’t just philosophical
or cosmetic - there’s a practical need for it. The practical need is
“disambiguation.”</p>

<p>When the player types a command, the parser tries to figure out what the
command means by looking up the associations between words and objects.
Sometimes, a word or phrase might refer to multiple objects. When this
happens, the command is <em>ambiguous</em>.</p>

<p>For example, suppose a room contains two cardboard boxes, one white and
one black, and the player types OPEN BOX. Does the player want to open
the white box or the black box? One way of answering the question is to
ask the player to be more specific: “Which box did you mean?” But the
player will be annoyed if we ask this sort of question too often,
especially if a human listener wouldn’t need to ask. For example, if the
white box is already open but the black box is closed, a human listener
would assume the player means OPEN BLACK BOX, since that’s the only way
the command is useful.</p>

<p>The parser uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> to get this sort of
information about what ought to be obvious to the player. When there’s
enough information to make the same kind of decision a human listener
would, the parser can successfully resolve the ambiguity without asking
the player for help - that is, the parser can <em>disambiguate</em> the command
by itself.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code>, in contrast, is for enforcing
conditions that <em>aren’t</em> obvious to the player, and thus can <em>not</em> be
used to resolve ambiguous references. For example, suppose we have our
two boxes again, but this time they’re both closed. Furthermore, suppose
that the white box is an ordinary box, but the black box has been glued
shut, so that it can’t be opened without some kind of tool.</p>

<p>Now, if the player types OPEN BOX, what does the player mean? The <em>game</em>
knows that OPEN BLACK BOX won’t work - but <em>the player doesn’t know this
until she tries it</em>. So from the player’s perspective, OPEN BLACK BOX is
a perfectly logical command: the box is closed, and to all appearances
it’s something that can normally be opened, so OPEN BLACK BOX makes
perfect sense. OPEN WHITE BOX likewise makes perfect sense. So it’s
equally logical for the player to mean either one: the parser has to ask
the player which box she meant in this case. The parser can’t assume
that the player meant OPEN WHITE BOX just because the game knows that
OPEN BLACK BOX won’t work. If the parser did this, it could take the
player by surprise - the player might really have meant OPEN WHITE BOX,
and would be surprised if the parser interpreted the command to mean
something else.</p>

<p>The point of separating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code>, then, is to let the parser ask
whether an action is logical, and then separately determine whether the
action is actually possible.</p>

<p>Now, this discussion raises another question. We can see why we need to
separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code>, but why do we need to separate
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action()</code>? In other words, why not just check
the “possibleness” conditions - the box being glued shut, for example -
during the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action()</code> phase?</p>

<p>The main reason to separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action()</code> comes into play with two-object
commands, such as PUT X IN Y. In these cases, we might have
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action()</code> handlers for both the direct and
indirect objects. The order of execution for the action handlers depends
on the verb - for PUT X IN Y, we run the indirect object handler first,
but for some verbs it’s the other way around. Now, if we did all of our
checking in one or the other action handler, we might run into a slight
problem: what if the action handler that runs second needs to block the
command?</p>

<p>The separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> phase solves this
problem. We run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> handlers for both
objects <em>before</em> we run <em>either</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action()</code>
handler. This ensures that either object can cancel the command before
any part of the command has been carried out.</p>

<p>This means that it’s important to remember that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code>, like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code>, shouldn’t actually carry out any
part of the command. In particular, these routines shouldn’t make any
changes to “game state” - they shouldn’t move any objects around, change
properties, etc. All game state changes should be put off until the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action()</code> phase, when we know that we’ve passed
all of our tests and that the action is allowed to proceed.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-about-this-from-disambiguation-an-extended-example">Thinking about this from disambiguation: an extended example</h2>

<p>Without recourse to a potentially confusing philosophical distinction
between logical and illogical, we can understand the use of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> stage as one which enables us to make
extra adjustments to interactive disambiguation questions. (Interactive
disambiguation questions are the questions which the game generates when
the player makes an ambiguous command: “Which fan do you mean? The….”)</p>

<p><em>An object which fails in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> phase is
favored over an object which fails in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> phase, as far as disambiguation is
concerned.</em> In fact, during disambiguation, the parser doesn’t even call
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> method. The parser calls the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> method to narrow down the field, and
then might have to ask the player to choose from the remaining objects,
but the parser doesn’t call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> at all
until after the objects have been chosen.</p>

<p>For example, we have three fans, one which is a fixed ceiling fan, which
can be turned on and off, one which is a takeable oscillating fan, but
which can only be taken when it is off, and one which is a hand-fan, a
stylized pingpong paddle if you will. First we’ll discuss
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> by itself, and then we’ll discuss
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> in combination with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="good-use-of-verify">Good use of verify()</h3>

<p>Say the player types:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;turn fan on
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We definitely want to exclude the hand-fan, since it’s obvious that the
hand-fan can’t be turned on or off, so this exclusion goes in the
verify. So we might get the following disambiguation question:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;turn fan on
Which fan do you mean, the oscillating fan, or the ceiling fan?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s say that one of these fans is already on – we would want to
eliminate this option also, or else we’re effectively asking: “Which fan
do you mean, the fan that’s already on, or the fan that is off?” The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> stage is designed to eliminate the
obviously silly interpretation of the command when there are other good
options.</p>

<p>So if the ceiling fan is on, and the oscillating fan is off, we want
something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;turn fan on
(the oscillating fan)
Done.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s think about the case in which all three fans fail the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> stage: the hand-fan obviously cannot
be turned on, the other two are already on, so they can’t be turned on
either. If the player types:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;turn fan on
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>– we need to ask which fan is intended, so that we can print the
appropriate failure message. So when all three fail the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> stage, a disambiguation question like
this is asked:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;turn fan on
Which fan do you mean, the hand-held fan, the oscillating fan,
or the ceiling fan?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All of these will fail, of course, but they’ll fail for different
reasons, so we need to ask which the player meant before we explain why
what the player is trying to do isn’t going to work.</p>

<h3 id="combining-verify-and-check">Combining verify() and check()</h3>

<p>So far we have an example of how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> is
used. Let’s continue with this example to explore how
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> is used in combination with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> to make the intended disambiguation
messages. We’ll change the verb from “turn on” to “take”.</p>

<p>The ceiling fan cannot be taken ever, since it’s attached to the
ceiling. The oscillating fan can be taken when it’s off. The hand-held
fan can be taken at any time. Let’s say the oscillating fan is off:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;take fan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s pretty clear what we want here:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;take fan
Which fan do you mean, the oscillating fan, or the hand-held fan?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the ceiling fan isn’t an option, since it can’t be taken: it
has failed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> stage. The two good
options are offered in interactive disambiguation.</p>

<p>Now what if the oscillating fan is on:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;take fan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What do we want here? The answer to this question determines whether or
not we want the oscillating fan’s takeable-condition to be in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code>.
Is it obvious to the player that the oscillating fan cannot be taken
when it is on? If not, we want this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;take fan
Which fan do you mean, the oscillating fan, or the hand-held fan?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above is produced when the fan.isOn condition goes in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code>. If we instead put this condition in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code>, we will get this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;take fan
(the hand-held fan)
Taken.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to eliminate the oscillating fan during object resolution,
then we put the condition in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code>, so that
the game will know that it’s supposed to assume the player is referring
to the hand-held fan when the oscillating fan is on. We should only do
this if it should be obvious to the player that the oscillating fan
cannot be taken when it’s on. (Making too many assumptions about what
the player means can spoil puzzles sometimes, and is somewhat intrusive
generally speaking. In this sense, “logical” means “what’s logical or
obvious <em>to the player</em>.” The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code> stage
being a logic test should be understood in this spirit.)</p>

<p>We can make one other consideration: let’s say that the hand-held fan is
directly contained by the player character. The oscillating fan is on,
and standing on the desk, and the ceiling fan is circling overhead. How
do we want to handle this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;take fan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Deciding this will also help us determine whether or not we want the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fan.isOn</code> condition to be in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code>.
If it’s not obvious that the oscillating fan cannot be taken, we want
the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;take fan
(the oscillating fan)
You try to take it, but it's too awkward to grab while it's oscillating.
Maybe you should turn it off first.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But if we want the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;take fan
Which fan do you mean, the ceiling fan [which cannot be taken], the
hand-held fan [which you already have], or the oscillating fan [which
cannot be taken because it's on]?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>– then we should put the oscillating fan’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOn</code> condition in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code>. Whether you want to assume that the
player means the oscillating fan in this case is up to you; the “logic”
will be different between games, based on the context, how obvious the
situation is to the player, and based on the game author’s sense of
taste in deciding what player knowledge should or should not be assumed.</p>

<p><em>The point is that you should choose where the condition goes based on
what you want to see in the disambiguation phase.</em></p>

<p>Of course, you don’t need three fans to make up your mind about where
the code should go, but you can imagine other objects in your game that
could be competing with your object, to help you determine where the
code should go from a stylistic point of view.</p>

<p>From a goal-oriented perspective, it all comes down to the practical
implications of putting a condition in one place or another, and often
there are no practical consequences, in fact, to the distinction between
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify()</code>; but you can imagine disambiguation
conflicts to insure you’re using the right style in principle.</p>

<h2 id="check-and-beforeaction"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforeAction()</code></h2>

<p>Traditionally, the library ran the “before” notifiers - beforeAction and
roomBeforeAction - <em>before</em> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> phase.
Starting with version 3.0.15.1 of the library, however, you can
optionally enable a new, alternative ordering that runs the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> phase first.</p>

<p>To enable the alternative ordering, set gameMain.beforeRunsBeforeCheck
to nil. By default, this property is set to true, which tells the
library to use the traditional ordering - “before” first - this ensures
that existing code will work as it always has.</p>

<p>The reason you might want to use the alternative ordering is that it
lets you consider a command to be more or less “committed” by the time
the “before” handlers are reached. In other words, the “before” handlers
can assume that the command will run to completion. The reason they can
make this assumption is that they know that they’re running after the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> phase. If the action makes it as far
as the “before” handlers at all, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code>
phase will have already judged the command to be acceptable as far as
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> tests are concerned.</p>

<p>So, when we get past the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> stage, we
know that a viable action is under way. Any objects which want to
interfere with that action can then do so with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforeAction()</code>. This means that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> can interrupt an action before other
objects, say NPC’s, have a chance to react to it. So a good use of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> can avoid sequences like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;ask stu about chair
As you are about to speak, Mary kicks you under the table. Glaring at
her, you redirect your question to Dave.
The large chair isn't something you need to be asking about.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above example, Mary’s response was a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforeAction()</code>, and the line about the large
chair being an unimportant topic was mistakenly placed in the action
phase rather than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> phase. By
failing the command before the action phase, we could have avoided
printing Mary’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforeAction()</code> message. So if
we want to tell the player that the chair is an unimportant topic before
Mary becomes involved, we need to use the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> phase.</p>

<p>It is important to remember, therefore, that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> really is another verification phase,
and not a preliminary action phase. Only if a command passes
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> should a change in game state be made.
In other words, some initial conditional statements should be part of
the action stage. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">check()</code> stage should not
perform preliminary checks which determine which action methods are
called.</p>
