<h1 id="workbench-project-starter-templates">Workbench Project Starter Templates</h1>

<p>TADS Workbench for Windows features a “New Project” command that
generates all of the files necessary to compile and run a skeleton game.
This saves the author the trouble of copying all of the boilerplate for
the .t3m and .t files making up the project.</p>

<p>If you’re creating your own library that’s designed to replace Adv3,
Workbench provides a way for you to plug in your own project starter
templates so that Workbench users can just as easily create new projects
based on your library. This section describes how to create a project
template.</p>

<h2 id="template-file-format">Template file format</h2>

<p>When Workbench displays the New Project dialog, it offers a list of
project configurations for the user to choose from. Each entry in this
list comes from a project starter template file, which has the suffix
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tdb-project-starter</code>. Workbench searches for all files with this
suffix in the Extensions folder, each folder in the Library Paths list,
and in the Workbench library folder. (Workbench searches all subfolders
of each of these folders as well.)</p>

<p>To create an entry for your library in the New Project dialog, then, you
just need to create a template file, and include it in your library
folder.</p>

<p>The template file contains text in a special format, with instructions
for Workbench on how to create the project. The file uses a simple
name/value pair format, with one item per line. An item looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    name: value
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> must be at the very start of the
line, with no leading spaces. If a line starts with one or more spaces,
it’s read as a continuation of the previous line. This allows you to
break up long values over several lines if needed for readability:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    name: This is a value that goes on for
      quite a while, requiring several lines
      to make it all fit neatly.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When Workbench reads the file, it joins these lines together as though
the value had appeared all on the same line. Workbench replaces each
line break, along with all of the leading spaces on the following line,
with a single space.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> elements and what
they mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code>: The title of the project
configuration. This is displayed in the New Project dialog in the list
of available project types. You should use something short and
descriptive; it doesn’t have to be an exhaustive description, because
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desc</code> value is also displayed in the same
list. The standard project starters included with Workbench use these
names:
    <ul>
      <li>Adv3 - Introductory</li>
      <li>Adv3 - Advanced</li>
      <li>Adv3 - Introductory - Web UI</li>
      <li>Adv3 - Advanced - Web UI</li>
      <li>Plain T3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desc</code>: A detailed description of the project.
This is displayed in the New Project dialog, under the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code>. This should be a couple of sentences
describing your library and the type of project this template would
create.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code>: The name of a source (.t) file that
you provide as part of your library folder, that’s meant to be
<strong>copied</strong> into the user’s new project folder. The value for this item
is the name of the file that you provide, optionally followed by a
space and the name of the file as it should appear in the user’s copy.
If you include only one name, the same name is used for the user’s
copy. If you provide two names, the second name can use a dollar sign
($) as a substitution parameter: this is replaced with the project
name that the New Project dialog asks the user to choose. For example,
suppose that the user enters “test one” as the project name. If you
enter this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code> item:</p>

    <p>` source: start.t $.t `</p>

    <p>then the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start.t</code> that you provide in
your library folder will be copied into the new project folder with
the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test one.t</code>.</p>

    <p>Note that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\$</code> can be used anywhere in the
target file name; it doesn’t have to be the entire name. For example,
if you write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\$-actors.t</code> in the example
above, the user’s copy of the file would be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test
one-actors.t</code>.</p>

    <p>You can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code> item repeatedly, if
you wish, to copy multiple source files to the new project folder.
Simply give each file a separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code>
line.</p>

    <p>You can place the source files to be copied into a subfolder of your
library folder. If you do, simply use a relative Windows-style path in
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code> line:</p>

    <p>` source: samples\start.t $.t `</p>

    <p>Workbench adds the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code> items to the new
project’s .t3m file in the same order in which they appear in the
template file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code>: The name of a source (.t) or library
(.tl) file to include in the project’s build list, but <strong>without</strong>
copying it to the user’s project folder. This is for files that will
be included in the project directly from your library. As with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code>, you can include as many
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code> items as you like.
Workbench adds the files named in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code> items
to the new project’s .t3m in the same order in which they appear in
the template file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sysfile</code>: The name of a <strong>system</strong> source
(.t) or library (.tl) file to include in the project’s build list.
This works just like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code>, except that these
files are taken from the Workbench standard library folder rather than
from your library folder. Use this for files like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tok.t</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tadsnet.t</code>
that come with the standard Workbench distribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define</code>: A preprocessor symbol to define. The
value is a symbol, optionally followed by an equals sign (=) and the
text to define for the symbol:</p>

    <p>` define: LANGUAGE=en_us `</p>

    <p>Workbench will generate the appropriate compiler option to define the
symbol in the macro preprocessor when the user builds the project. You
can use as many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define</code> options as you need;
simply use a separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define</code> item for each
symbol you wish to define.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence</code>: A number giving the sorting order
for this item. This is intended for use by the standard templates
included with Workbench; replacement libraries should generally omit
this. When displaying the list of available project types, Workbench
puts items with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence</code> items at the top of
the list, in order of their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence</code> values,
followed by the remaining items sorted in alphabetic order of their
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> strings. The intention is that standard
system items are displayed first, followed by third-party libraries.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here’s the template included with the standard Workbench installation
for the Introductory Adv3 Web UI project type.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    name: Adv3 - Introductory - Web UI
    sequence: 3
    desc: Create a game based on the Adv3 library for Web browser play.
      Your new project will be set up for deployment on Web servers, so
      that users can play in a browser without installing any TADS
      software.  This project starter includes a working game scenario 
      as an example to help you get started.
    source: samples\startI3.t $.t
    lib: adv3web.tl
    sysfile: webui.tl
    sysfile: tadsnet.t
    define: TADS_INCLUDE_NET
    define: LANGUAGE=en_us
    define: MESSAGESTYLE=neu
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>To distribute your library, simply create a ZIP file with all of your
.t, .tl, and .tdb-project-starter files. Instruct users to install your
library by following these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run Workbench, and verify that the Extensions folder is set up. This
setting can be found by selecting the Tools - Options menu command and
going to the System - Extensions pane. The Workbench installer
normally sets this to “My Documents\TADS 3\Extensions”, but users can
change it if they prefer to keep extensions somewhere else. If there’s
no setting, the user should set it now.</li>
  <li>Create a folder especially for your library in the Extensions folder.</li>
  <li>Unzip your library files into the new folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s no extra step to install your project template. Simply include
the .tdb-project-starter file in the folder containing your library’s .t
and .tl files. Workbench automatically searches for .tdb-project-starter
files in the Extensions folder tree (including sub-folders) and all of
the folders in Library Paths list.</p>
