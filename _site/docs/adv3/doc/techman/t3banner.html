<h1 id="using-the-banner-api">Using the Banner API</h1>

<p><em>by Eric Eve</em></p>

<p><em>Note: the customBanner.t source file described in this article can be
found in the</em> lib/extensions <em>folder in the standard TADS 3 Author’s Kit
and library distributions.</em></p>

<p><em>Important Note: the Banner API cannot be used with games compiled for
the Web UI; if you want to use the Banner API you must compile your game
for use with a traditional HTML-TADS interpreter.</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Banner API in TADS 3 is the feature that allows the interpreter
screen to be divided into a number of different windows during game
execution. Normally a TADS 3 game uses two windows, the main window in
which commands are entered and the game’s responses are displayed, and
the status line banner at the top, which typically shows the current
room, the current turn count and score, and a list of currently
available exits. This is more often than not quite sufficient for most
text adventures/masterly works of Interactive Fiction, but occasionally
an author may want something more elaborate.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, we were writing a game in which we wanted to
display a picture of every room the player character visits, along with
pictures of some of the objects he or she examines. Rather than having
our pictures incorporated into the text shown in the main window, where
they would soon scroll out of sight, we might want them displayed in a
separate window where they remain in view until replaced by another
picture. With this arrangement we might also want a separate caption
window to display some text describing what the current picture is a
picture of. To implement this scheme, we might want to divide the
available screen space up something like this:</p>

<p>Status</p>

<p>Picture</p>

<p>Caption</p>

<p>Main</p>

<p>The TADS 3 library already takes care of the status line for us, but we
would need to implement the picture banner window and the caption banner
window. Not only would we need to arrange these banners correctly on
screen and update them with the right contents, but we should also need
to ensure that our code took care of issues such as the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensuring that the banner window <em>layout</em> is still correct after an
UNDO, RESTART or RESTORE</li>
  <li>Ensuring that the contents of each banner window is shown correctly
after an UNDO, RESTART or RESTORE</li>
  <li>Catering for the possibility that our game might be run on an
interpreter which lacks the capability to display graphics</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic banner window model is described in the <em>System Manual</em>
article on <a href="../sysman/banners.html">The Banner Window Display Model</a>. If
you are not already reasonably familiar with this, you might like to
read it now, since the present article assumes some understanding of the
screen layout model it describes. This might also be a good point to
take a look at the the <em>System Manual</em>’s description of the low-level
banner API functions in the section on the <a href="../sysman/tadsio.html">tads-io Function
Set</a>. Although these low-level functions are not
the best way to manipulate banners in a TADS 3 game, some understanding
of what they do may nevertheless be helpful for seeing the range of
banner functions available. In particular it is useful to refer to the
bannerCreate() function, and in particular its argument list, since even
if we end up using alternatives to bannerCreate(), our alternatives will
still use much the same list of arguments.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-tadsio-banner-api-functions"><span id="tadsio">Using the tadsio Banner API Functions</span></h2>

<p>Although you would probably not want to use the low-level Banner API
functions in a real game, it’s worth taking a quick look at how one
might use them to start implementing the banner layout shown above,
since this at least introduces some important principles.</p>

<p>For ease of reference, let’s repeat that layout diagram here:</p>

<p>Status</p>

<p>Picture</p>

<p>Caption</p>

<p>Main</p>

<p>The main thing to notice about this layout is that the space between the
status line banner is divided into two windows, one for the picture, and
the other for the caption. To create such a layout we first need to
create a horizontal division within the main window, with the upper area
being used for our two new banners. We then need to divide that new area
vertically into left-hand and right-hand regions. The way the banner
display model works, we do that by creating <em>one</em> new child window from
our new window, and assigning it to (say) half the available space.</p>

<p>It doesn’t much matter whether we create the picture window or the
caption window first, but there is perhaps some logic in starting with
the picture window (since the caption window is in some sense
subservient to it in function, so that if we decided to remove the
picture window at some point, we wouldn’t want to retain the caption
window).</p>

<p>We could create the picture window using the low level function
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerCreate()</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    picWin = bannerCreate(nil, BannerAfter, statuslineBanner.handle_, BannerTypeText, 
                  BannerAlignTop, 10, BannerSizeAbsolute, BannerStyleBorder);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument here is the parent window of the new window we’re
creating. In this case the parent is the main window so we use the value
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>. The second and third arguments define
where in the parent window we want our new banner created; in this case,
we want it after the status line banner. There’s a slight complication
here, in that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerCreate</code> expects us to
specify not the sibling banner <em>object</em> here but the sibling banner’s
<em>handle</em>, which is simply an integer that the system uses internally to
keep track of which banner is which.</p>

<p>The fifth argument, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAlignTop</code>, stipulates
that we want our new banner to appear at the top of the available space
we’re carving out of the main window, but after the statusline banner.
The sixth argument is the size (in this case depth) of our new banner
window (at this stage its width is simply the full screen width), the
seventh argument, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerSizeAbsolute</code>
stipulates that this is an absolute size, the unit being lines of text
in the default font of the window. Finally we give our new banner a
border with the last argument.</p>

<p>At this stage, our window layout will look something this this:</p>

<p>Status</p>

<p>Picture</p>

<p>Main</p>

<p>The next job is to create the Caption banner window. We want this to
occupy the right hand half of the space currently occupied by the
picture banner, so we make it a child of picWin, align it to the right,
and assign it 50% of the space:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    captionWin = bannerCreate(picWin, BannerFirst, nil, BannerTypeText, 
                  BannerAlignRight, 50, BannerSizePercent, BannerStyleBorder);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time the second and third arguments are
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerFirst</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>
respectively, since we want this new banner to be the first (in this
case rightmost) child of its parent, which means in turn that we don’t
need to name a sibling for it to come before or after (in any case, it
has no siblings).</p>

<p>At this point we need to stop and ask the question, what kind of values
are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pcWin</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">captionWin</code>? They are, in fact, banner handles,
which as we’ve already seen, are simply integers. This being so we need
some place we can store a reference to them so we can refer to them
later; that place will almost certainly need to be a pair of object
properties, which means in turn that we need to create an object in
which to store them. While we’re at it, we could make it an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InitObject</code> so that it can automatically create
our banner layout at startup:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    banners:InitObject
       picWin = nil
       captionWin = nil
       
       initLayout()
       {
         picWin = bannerCreate(nil, BannerAfter, statuslineBanner.handle_, BannerTypeText, 
                  BannerAlignTop, 10, BannerSizeAbsolute, BannerStyleBorder);

         captionWin = bannerCreate(picWin, BannerFirst, nil , BannerTypeText, 
                  BannerAlignRight, 50, BannerSizePercent, BannerStyleBorder);
       }

       execute() {  initLayout(); }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, when we want to display anything in our new banner windows, we can
simply use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerSay()</code> method; e.g. to
display a picture of a banner with a caption:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    bannerSay(banners.picWin, '&lt;img src="pics/sheldonian.jpg"&gt;');
    bannerSay(banners.captionWin, 'A view of Oxford\'s famous Sheldonian Theatre,
       designed by Sir Christopher Wren');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So far, this works reasonably well, and it serves to illustrate some of
the main principles of working with banners in TADS 3, but there a great
many issues we have not dealt with. For example, if the player issues an
UNDO command just after we have updated our banner windows with new
content, the new content will remain on screen, and won’t automatically
roll back to what was shown on the previous turn. There’s also nothing
to handle what should happen when a game is restored, or when it’s
played on an interpreter that can’t handle graphics. It would no doubt
be possible to add further sophisications to the basic code shown above
to handle all these situations, but this may not be the best method to
proceed, so from now on we’ll look at an alternative: controlling banner
windows through the BannerWindow class.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-bannerwindow-class"><span id="BannerWindow">Using the BannerWindow class</span></h2>

<p>The main difference from the previous approach is that instead of
calling low-level tadsio methods, we define objects to represent the
various banner windows we want to create, and then use their methods to
manipulate them. In essence we create:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    picWindow: BannerWindow
    ;

    captionWindow: BannerWindow
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course the above definitions will not actually do anything, since
they don’t define where our two new banners are to appear, or do
anything to make them appear. But they do illustrate one point: whereas
before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">picWindow</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">captionWindow</code> were properties of a separate
object we had to create for the purpose, now they are objects in their
own right. The identifiers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">picWindow</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">captionWindow</code> thus refer to <em>objects</em> and not
to integers representing handles. The handle values we used before would
now be given by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">picWindow.handle\_</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">captionWindow.handle\_</code>, but in fact we
probably won’t need to refer to these handles any more, since we can now
refer to the objects instead. Indeed, if we <em>did</em> refer to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">handle\_</code> properties at this point, we’d find
they were both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, since we’ve done nothing
to create the actual banner windows in the screen layout.</p>

<p>To make a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerWindow</code> object actually do
something to the screen layout, we need to do the equivalent of invoking
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerCreate()</code> function, which is to evoke
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerWindow</code>’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showBanner()</code> method (which in fact does itself
call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerCreate()</code>, after carrying out lot of
intermediate background busy-work to help keep track of what’s going
on). A good place to call this method if we want our banners to be
included in the screen layout at startup is their
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initBannerWindow()</code> method, since this is
called during game initialization. Following the same logic we used
before, as a first attempt we might try:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    picWindow: BannerWindow
       initBannerWindow()
       {
          showBanner(nil, BannerAfter, statuslineBanner, BannerTypeText, 
                  BannerAlignTop, 10, BannerSizeAbsolute, BannerStyleBorder);

          /* 
           * inherited() here simply sets inited_ to true, to show that we have
           * now initialized this banner.
           */
        
          inherited();
         
       }
    ;

    captionWindow: BannerWindow
       initBannerWindow()
       {
          showBanner(picWindow, BannerFirst, nil , BannerTypeText, 
                  BannerAlignRight, 50, BannerSizePercent, BannerStyleBorder);  
       
          inherited();
       }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you may have noticed, the arguments to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showBanner()</code> are almost identical to those of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerCreate()</code>, with one important difference:
in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showBanner()</code> the first and third arguments
(if present), representing the parent and sibling of this window, are
now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerWindow</code> <em>objects</em>, not integers
representing handles.</p>

<p>If you actually tried to run the above code, however, there’s a good
chance you’d encounter a run-time error. The problem is that there’s now
nothing in our code to control the <em>order</em> in which our banner windows
are created (we can’t rely on source text order to determine it), with
the result that the VM may attempt to initialize
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">captionWindow</code> before
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">picWindow</code>; this will cause an error because
you must create the parent banner before any of its children; in fact
you must create it before <em>any</em> of the other banners listed among the
arguments it uses in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showBanner()</code>, whether a
parent banner, or a sibling banner we’re to be placed before or after.</p>

<p>The trick is to ensure that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initBannerWindow()</code>
calls the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initBannerWindow()</code> methods of any
banners that must already exist. So as a second attempt we might try:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    picWindow: BannerWindow
       initBannerWindow()
       {
          statusLineBanner.initBannerWindow();

          showBanner(nil, BannerAfter, statuslineBanner, BannerTypeText, 
                  BannerAlignTop, 10, BannerSizeAbsolute, BannerStyleBorder);
        
          inherited();
         
       }
    ;

    captionWindow: BannerWindow
       initBannerWindow()
       {
          picWindow.initBannerWindow();

          showBanner(picWindow, BannerFirst, nil , BannerTypeText, 
                  BannerAlignRight, 50, BannerSizePercent, BannerStyleBorder);  
       
          inherited();
       }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now if the initialization routine happens upon
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">captionWindow</code> before
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">picWindow</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">captionWindow.initBannerWindow()</code> will invoke
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">picWindow.initBannerWindow()</code> before calling
its own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showBanner()</code> method, thereby ensuring
that the banner created for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">picWindow</code> exists
before we try to give it a child. Unfortunately, this at once leads us
to another problem, namely that if
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">captionWindow.initBannerWindow()</code> runs first,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">picWindow.initBannerWindow()</code> will be called a
second time when the initializer reaches
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">picWindow</code>, with the result that we could end
up with two picture banners displayed on screen.</p>

<p>To avoid that, we make use of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inited\_</code>
property set by the inherited method. If
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inited\_</code> is true, we know we have already been
initialized, so we don’t need to be initialized again. We can therefore
check the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inited\_</code> at the start of
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initBannerWindow()</code> method:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    picWindow: BannerWindow
       initBannerWindow()
       {
          if(inited_)
             return;

          statuslineBanner.initBannerWindow();

          showBanner(nil, BannerAfter, statuslineBanner, BannerTypeText, 
                  BannerAlignTop, 10, BannerSizeAbsolute, BannerStyleBorder);
        
          inherited();
         
       }
    ;

    captionWindow: BannerWindow
       initBannerWindow()
       {
          if(inited_)
             return; 

          picWindow.initBannerWindow();

          showBanner(picWindow, BannerFirst, nil , BannerTypeText, 
                  BannerAlignRight, 50, BannerSizePercent, BannerStyleBorder);  
       
          inherited();
       }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, you may be getting the impression that it was more
straightforward to use the low level banner API functions, except that
we no longer need to create a special object to hold references to the
banner handles. But in fact the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerWindow</code>
class, and the classes associated with it in banner.t, are taking care
of a lot of the complexity for us. In particular, although they don’t
address the issue of keeping the banner <em>contents</em> in sync with any
UNDO, RESTORE or RESTART operations the player may perform, they do look
after the business of ensuring that the banner <em>layout</em> (which is all we
have handled so far) is properly maintained through these operations.
This may not seem much of an issue in this example, which envisages a
banner layout that remains constant throughout the game, but would be
more of an issue in a game in which the banner layout changed according
to circumstance.</p>

<p>In order to display actual content in these banner windows, we simply
need to call their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeToBanner()</code> method; for
example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    picWindow.writeToBanner('&lt;img src="pics/sheldonian.jpg"&gt;');
    captionWindow.writeToBanner('A view of Oxford\'s famous Sheldonian Theatre,
       designed by Sir Christopher Wren');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This method is perfectly workable if either of the following conditions
is true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our game updates the banner contents each turn</li>
  <li>Our game updates the banner contents each time the room description is
displayed (e.g. because we want to show a picture of the location as
well as describing it)</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the library automatically performs a look around after a
RESTORE, RESTART or UNDO command, issuing any of these commands will
accordingly automatically update our banner contents for us if they are
updated with each look around.</p>

<p>However, if neither of the above conditions is met, then we still have
to find some means of updating our banner contents after a RESTORE or
UNDO (though our initialization code will probably take care of
RESTART). One way to do this is to define a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">currentContents</code> property on each of our
banners that gets updated with whatever we write to the banners, so that
we can arrange for it to be displayed again after a RESTORE or UNDO.
That’s not too hard to do, but we also have to make sure that we do
things in the right order if the layout might change, that if we UNDO or
RESTORE from a point in the game where, say, our picture banner isn’t
displayed to one where it is, we must ensure that we redisplay the
picture banner before we try to write to it.</p>

<p>And we still haven’t dealt with the issue of the not-HTML interpreter.
To be sure, if the interpreter our game runs on can’t display graphics,
say, our attempts to display graphics on it won’t do too much harm,
since they’ll simply be ignored. The problem is rather that we may have
a banner window taking up space on a text-only display while doing
nothing useful; if we only created the banner in order to display
pictures on it, then there’s simply no point in having it created when
our game runs on an interpreter that can’t display pictures. On the
other hand, if test for the interpreter type and then don’t create our
graphics banner, our code may well run into difficulties when it tries
to write to it.</p>

<p>In fact, dealing with the banner content on RESTORE/UNDO problem and the
reasonable compatibility with different interpreter types problem can
prove more than a little tricky, not least because these two problems
can impact on each other. Consider the case when the player of your
Multimedia Masterpiece starts on his desk-top Windows PC with a full
HTML interpeter. He then saves the game and copies the save file to a
portable device which runs a text-only interpreter, so he can carry on
playing on the train or bus on the way to work. When the game is
restored on the handheld, which can’t display graphics, we may decide we
don’t want the graphics window to appear, even though it was part of the
layout saved in the save file. Now, when our intrepid adventurer returns
at the end of his long hard day in the office to relax with your Epic
Extravaganza once more, having played on a few dozen turns on his
portable device, he saves the game in his text-only interpreter, copies
the saved file to his desk-top machine, restores the game to his HTML
interpreter, and carries on playing. What the restore on the HTML
interpreter ought to achieve is to show the banner layout and content
appropriate to the stage of the game now reached, even though these
weren’t being shown on the text-only interpreter in the interim. This is
possible to arrange, but it is also quite tricky.</p>

<p>In the next section, we’ll look at using a class that takes care of most
of these issues for you.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-custombannerwindow-class"><span id="CustomBannerWindow">Using the CustomBannerWindow Class</span></h2>

<p>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code>, the banners we
defined in the previous section could be defined simply with:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    picWindow: CustomBannerWindow
       bannerArgs = [nil, BannerAfter, statuslineBanner, BannerText, 
                  BannerTop, 10, BannerSizeAbsolute, BannerStyleBorder]      
    ;

    captionWindow: CustomBannerWindow
       bannerArgs = [picWindow, BannerFirst, nil , BannerText, 
                    BannerRight, 50, BannerSizePercent, BannerStyleBorder]   
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code in fact does much the same as the code we ended up with using
BannerWindow. In particular,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow.initBannerWindow()</code> follows
the coding pattern we used above, but works out from the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannerArgs</code> property which other BannerWindows
it needs to initialize first. Using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> thus saves both quite a bit
of typing and the danger of some errors.</p>

<p>But it can do quite a bit more for us besides.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> is a subclass of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerWindow</code> and inherits all its methods,
which you can still use, but it also defines a number of methods and
properties of its own. So, for example, while you can still call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writeToBanner()</code> on a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow()</code>, to take advantage of
this class it’s more useful to update its contents with its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateContents()</code> method. This does two things:
first it stores the banner’s new contents (as defined by the string
argument of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateContents()</code>) in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">currentContents</code> property, and then displays
the contents of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">currentContents</code> property
in the banner. By itself this storing of the banner’s output in a banner
property may not seem very exciting, but the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> also takes care of
displaying its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">currentContents</code> property on
RESTORE, UNDO or RESTART (and, indeed, on startup). This means that as
long as you consistently use the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateContents()</code> method to display content in
a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code>, the RESTORE/UNDO/RESTART
issue is automatically taken care of for you. It also means that you can
use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">currentContents</code> property to stipulate
what you want a banner to play at the start of the game, for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    picWindow: CustomBannerWindow
       bannerArgs = [nil, BannerAfter, statuslineBanner, BannerText, 
                  BannerTop, 10, BannerSizeAbsolute, BannerStyleBorder]      

       currentContents = '&lt;img src="welcome.jpg"&gt;'
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from initialization, however, your game code should not modify
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">currentContents</code> directly (unless for some very
peculiar purpose), but should allow
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateContents()</code> to keep the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">currentContents</code> property in sync with what the
banner actually displays.</p>

<p>We said above that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateContents()</code> method
does two things; actually it normally does three: normally it clears the
banner window before displaying the new content. This is typically what
you’d want for a banner that displays a picture that reflects the
current situation, say. But it may not always be what you want, e.g. for
a scrolling window to which text is added cumulatively. So if you don’t
want a particular banner to be cleared before displaying new content in
it via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateContents()</code>, you need to override
its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clearBeforeUpdate</code> property to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>.</p>

<p>CustomBannerWindow can also help us with the varying interpreter type
issue. To recapitulate, the problem is not that trying to display a
picture (say) on a non-HTML interpreter will of itself cause an error,
but that displaying a picture banner on a non-HTML interpreter will take
up screen space for no good purpose, making your game look rather kludgy
on the text-only ‘terp. Ideally, it would be best if, in this case, the
picture banner simply wasn’t part of the screen layout on the non-HTML
interpreter, but if our game doesn’t even initialize the banner on the
non-HTML interpreter, then attempting to display a picture (or anything
else) in it <em>will</em> cause a run-time error. What we’d ideally like is a
means of deciding whether we want a particular banner to display on a
particular class of interpreter, and have attempts to write to the
banner simply ignored if the banner isn’t displayed.</p>

<p>CustomBannerWindow provides the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canDisplay</code>
property for this purpose. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canDisplay</code>
evaluates to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initBannerWindow()</code> will not add the banner to
the screen layout, but we can nevertheleess call any of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerWindow</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> methods without causing a
run-time error, since they’ll then all be ignored (except that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateContents()</code> will still update the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">currentContents</code> property, even though nothing
will be shown on screen).</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canDisplay</code> property is meant to be used
with in conjunction with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SystemInfo()</code>
function, to determine the kind of interpreter we’re running on. So, for
example, to suppress the display of a banner on an interpreter than
can’t display JPEGs we’d define:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    canDisplay = (systemInfo(SysInfoJpeg))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The main thing we need to be careful about here ensuring that we don’t
define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canDisplay</code> methods that can evaluate to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> on a parent window and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> on one or more of its child windows at
the same time. So if we are designing a banner layout in which one
window (a text-diplay window, say) is always required, but another (a
graphics window, say) is only required if our game is running on an HTML
interpreter, we must be careful <em>not</em> to make the text-display window a
child of the graphics window.</p>

<p>In the example we have been using, our caption banner <em>is</em> a child of
our picture banner, but this is okay since we don’t want either banner
to display if we can’t display graphics: there’s no point in showing the
picture caption without the picture. To ensure that both our custom
banners either do or don’t display together, it’s slightly less work and
slightly less error-prone to override the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> class than to override the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canDisplay</code> property separately on each window:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify CustomBannerWindow
       canDisplay = (systemInfo(SysInfoJpeg))
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s safe to do this since the only CustomBannerWindows that exist in
our game are the ones we create ourselves. The banner windows defined in
the library, such as the statusline banner and various banners used in
displaying menus are of class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerWindow</code>,
and so won’t be affected by any changes we make to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canDisplay</code> property is intended purely for
testing the interpreter type. We can use a different property,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isActive</code>, to add or remove a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> from the display during the
course of our game. More accurately, we can define the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isActive</code> property as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> on a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> we don’t want displayed at
game start-up, and then use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">activate()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deactivate()</code> methods to add or remove custom
banners to or from the screen. Once again, it’s our responsibility to
respect the dependency order of any parent, child or sibling banners
involved.</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>

<p>Suppose we want to use the banner layout described above in the
following way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some of the rooms and some of the objects in our game have a picture.</li>
  <li>When an object that has a picture is examined, we display its picture
together with a caption describing that picture.</li>
  <li>When the player character enters a room that has a picture, we display
that picture together with its caption.</li>
  <li>When the player character enters a room that doesn’t have a picture,
we remove our custom banners from the screen layout.</li>
  <li>If a room has a picture, we display it in response to an explicit LOOK
command.</li>
  <li>It follows that when a picture is displayed, it remains on screen
until a movement, look or examine command changes it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether this scheme is necessarily a good idea is beside the point for
the present exercise (it would be distracting if the banners kept
appearing and disappearing as we moved from room to room, perhaps less
so if this only happened once or twice as we moved between regions). The
point of it here is to serve as a convenient implementation example.</p>

<p>To begin with, we note that a picture and its caption always go
together. That suggests that picture and caption might usefully be
encapsulated together in a class that also contain the method to display
them to our banners. For the sake of argument we assume that our picture
files all have a .jpg extension and that they’re all in the /docs folder
under our game folder:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class Picture
      picFile = ''
      caption = ''
      showPic()
      {
        /* 
         *  We can't be sure that the banners will be active when we want to
         *  display in them, so we need to check and, if necessary, activate
         *  them.
         */
        if(!picWindow.isActive)
        {
          /* We must be careful to activate the parent window before its child */ 
          picWindow.activate();
          captionWindow.activate();
        }
      
      
        picWindow.updateContents('&lt;body bgcolor=statusbg&gt;
             &lt;img src="pics/' + picFile + '.jpg" &gt;');
                     
        captionWindow.updateContents('&amp;lt;- ' + caption);  
      }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;lt;-</code> in the last line is
deliberate here; we want this to appear in the window as &lt;-, but since
what we send to the window will be interpreted as HTML, we need to use
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;lt;</code> entity to represent the &lt; character.</p>

<p>Since we may be defining many Picture objects, we can save ourselves a
bit of typing by defining an appropriate template:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    Picture template 'picFile' 'caption';
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we need to modify the Room and Thing classes to display their
pictures (and accompanying captions) if they have them:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify Room
        pic = nil
      
        enteringRoom(traveler) 
        {        
          if(traveler == gPlayerChar)
            showPic();          
        }    
        
        showPic()
        {
           
          /* If we have no pic, remove the banners from screen */
          if(pic == nil)
          {
            /* Note we must be careful to deactivate the child banner before its parent */
            captionWindow.deactivate();
            picWindow.deactivate();
          }     
          else
            pic.showPic();
        }
    ;

    modify Thing
      pic = nil

      mainExamine()
      {
        inherited();
        if(pic)
          pic.showPic();
      }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We next need to make an explicit LOOK command display any relevant
picture and caption for the player character’s current location. For the
purposes of this example, we only want an explicit LOOK to do this, not
an implicit lookAround called by the library code. We therefore need to
make a minor override to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LookAction</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify LookAction
      execAction()
      {
        inherited();
        
        local loc = gActor.getOutermostRoom();
        if(loc.pic)
          loc.showPic();
      } 
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our final task is to make the picture and caption of the starting
location appear on the first turn. The easiest way to achieve that may
be to call the room’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showPic()</code> method from
` gameMain.showIntro()`:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    gameMain: GameMainDef  
        initialPlayerChar = me
        
        showIntro() { startRoom.showPic(); }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this is all we need to do to implement our scheme; the
` CustomBannerWindow` class can be left to do
the rest, such as displaying the right picture and caption (or absence
of picture and caption) after RESTORE, RESTART and UNDO. At this point
we can start defining our rooms and objects, e.g.:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    startRoom: OutdoorRoom 'Radcliffe Square' 'Radcliffe Square'
        "From the south-east corner of Radcliffe Square you could go north between
         the Radcliffe Camera and All Souls College. "
        
        pic: Picture {
          'rad_square'
          'A view from the south-east quadrant of Radcliffe Square'
        }
        
        north = catteStreet    
    ; 


    + me: Actor    
    ;

    + radcliffeCamera: Fixture 'radcliffe camera' 'Radcliffe Camera'
       "This iconic round building, designed by James Gibbs, is now
        part of the Bodleian Library, holding among other things the
        open-shelf undergraduate collections for English Literature
        and Theology. "
       pic: Picture {
         'camera'
         'A view of the Radcliffe Camera from the south side of
          Radcliffe Square'
       }
       cannotEnterMsg = 'You don\'t have your Bod card with you. '
    ;

    + allSouls: Fixture 'all souls souls\' college' 'All Souls College'
      "Founded in 1438, the All Souls traditionally takes no undergraduates. "
      pic: Picture{
         'all_souls'
         'All Souls College seen from Radcliffe Square'
      }
      cannotEnterMsg = 'It\'s not your college, and you don\'t have time
       to go sightseeing right now. '
      isProper = true
    ;

    catteStreet: OutdoorRoom 'Catte Street' 'Catte Street'
      "Catte Street runs north from Radcliffe Square to the main crossroads.
        Along the way it passes such famous landmarks as the Sheldonian Theatre
        and the Bridge of Sighs. "
      pic: Picture {
        'catte'
        'Looking up Catte Street, with the Bodleian Libary to the left'
      }
      south = startRoom
      north = crossroads
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="working-with-a-more-complicated-layout">Working with a More Complicated Layout</h2>

<p>As a final exercise, let’s suppose that we want a slightly more
complicated banner layout than the one we’ve been working with so far
(in practice, we probably don’t actually <em>need</em> one here, but we’re just
taking the opportunity to show how it might be done). Suppose, for the
sake of argument, that we don’t want our picture window and banner
window to occupy the full screen width, but instead want to frame them
with left, centre, and right banners (that will always remain empty)
thus:</p>

<p>Status</p>

<p>L</p>

<p>Picture</p>

<p>C</p>

<p>Caption</p>

<p>R</p>

<p>Main</p>

<p>In this case we effectively have a horizontal band between the status
line and the main window, which we need to divide into five regions.
It’s probably easiest to start by defining the central border as the
parent banner, and then carve the other four windows out of it. The
definition of the central banner is then something like the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    centreWindow: CustomBannerWindow
      bannerArgs = [nil, BannerAfter, statuslineBanner, BannerTypeText, BannerAlignTop,
        15, BannerSizeAbsolute, BannerStyleBorder]

      currentContents = '&lt;body bgcolor=statusbg&gt;'
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we need the left and right frames to go on the outside, we need to
define them next. The point to bear in mind here is that we are going to
define the remaining windows with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAlignLeft</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerAlignRight</code>, and that the earliest
windows in sequence take the outermost positions, and that windows
defined as coming immediately <em>after</em> them will thus appear closer to
the centre. It doesn’t much matter, however, whether the outer left
window or the outer right window comes first: here we’ll start with the
outer right:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    rightWindow: CustomBannerWindow
       bannerArgs = [centreWindow, BannerFirst,nil, BannerTypeText, BannerAlignRight,
        5, BannerSizePercent, BannerStyleBorder]

      currentContents = '&lt;body bgcolor=statusbg&gt;'
    ;

    leftWindow: CustomBannerWindow
       bannerArgs = [centreWindow, BannerAfter, rightWindow, BannerTypeText, 
          BannerAlignLeft,  5, BannerSizePercent, 0]

      currentContents = '&lt;body bgcolor=statusbg&gt;'
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can define our picture window and our caption window as before,
this time placing them after the left-hand and right-hand framing
windows respectively:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    picWindow: CustomBannerWindow
      bannerArgs = [centreWindow, BannerAfter,  leftWindow,  BannerTypeText, 
         BannerAlignLeft, 35, BannerSizeAbsolute, BannerStyleBorder]
                     
      autoSize = true               
    ;

    captionWindow: CustomBannerWindow
      bannerArgs = [centreWindow, BannerAfter, rightWindow, BannerTypeText, BannerAlignRight,
                      40, BannerSizePercent, BannerStyleBorder ]     
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only other change we need to make is in the methods that remove and
restore the complete set of banner windows to and from the display:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class Picture: object
      picFile = ''
      caption = ''
      showPic()
      {
        if(!picWindow.isActive)
        {
          /*
           * We must be careful to activate the parent window before all
           * its children, and the older sibling windows before the younger
           * siblings that are placed in relation to them.
           *
           * We also call activate with the optional (true) argument on
           * centreWindow, rightWindow and leftWindow to force display of
           * their current contents on activation (their current contents being
           * HTML code to set their background colour to the background colour
           * of the status line)
           */
          centreWindow.activate(true);
          rightWindow.activate(true);
          leftWindow.activate(true);
          picWindow.activate();
          captionWindow.activate(); 

        }
      
      
        picWindow.updateContents('&lt;body bgcolor=statusbg&gt;
             &lt;img src="pics/' + picFile + '.jpg" &gt;');
                     
        captionWindow.updateContents('&amp;lt;- ' + caption);  
      }
    ;


    modify Room
      roomPic = nil
      
      enteringRoom(traveler) 
        {       
          if(traveler == gPlayerChar)
            showPic();          
        }    
        
        showPic()
        {
          if(roomPic == nil)
          {
            /*  
             *  The windows need to be deactivated in reverse order of
             *  activation, so that we deactivate all the child windows
             *  before deactivating the parent.
             */
            captionWindow.deactivate();
            picWindow.deactivate();
            leftWindow.deactivate();
            rightWindow.deactivate();
            centreWindow.deactivate();
          }     
          else
            roomPic.showPic();
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Hopefully the foregoing examples will give you a reasonable idea how to
implement the banner layout you want in your own game, or at least to
experiment with the banner API a little more productively. In conclusion
it may be helpful to summarize the methods and properties you will most
commonly want to use when working with the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomerBannerWindow</code> class.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**activate(*\[txt\|true\]*)**</code>: call this
method to add or restore to the screen a previously inactive banner
(one defined with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isActive = nil</code> or removed
by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deactivate()</code>) This method takes one
optional argument, which may either be the value
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>, in which case the banner displays its
current contents on activation, or a single-quoted string, in which
case the banner displays that single-quoted string on activation.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**autoSize**</code>: set to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> to have the banner size to contents
after each update of its contents. The default is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**bannerArgs**</code>: this is the one property
that every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> <em>must</em> define.
It should consist of a list containing exactly eight elements in the
form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[*parent, where, other, windowType, align,
size, sizeUnits, styleFlags*\]</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**canDisplay**</code>: if you want your banner to
be displayed on every interpreter that can display banners, this can
simply be set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>. Otherwise it should
normally contain the result of a call to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SystemInfo</code> function to determine what class
of interpreter this banner should be used on, e.g.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canDisplay = (SystemInfo(SysInfoJpeg))</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**clearBeforeUpdate**</code>: set to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true </code> to have the banner window cleared just
before writing new content to it, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>
otherwise. The default is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true </code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**clearWindow()**</code>: clear the banner window.
This is much the same as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clearWindow()</code>
method on ` BannerWindow`, except that it
checks that the banner is active before attempting to do anything, so
that it’s safe to call on an inactive banner.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**currentContents**</code>: the current contents
displayed by this banner, if it is on screen. This may be overridden
when defining a banner instance to give the contents that the banner
should display when it is first added to the screen layout.
Thereafter, use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateBanner()</code> method to
change what the banner displays.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**deactivate(*\[txt\|true\]*)**</code>: remove a
currently active banner from the screen layout. This method optionally
takes one argument. If the argument is the actual value
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> then the currentContents of the banner
are reset to a zero-length string. If the argument is a single-quoted
string then the current contents are set to that string.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**flushBanner()**</code>: flush any pending output
to the banner; if we’re inactive, do nothing.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**isActive**</code>: override to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> on a banner you want to start out not
being displayed on screen. Don’t manipulate this property directly
thereafter; use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">activate()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deactivate()</code> methods instead.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**setSize(*size, sizeUnits, isAdvisory*)**</code>:
Set the banner window to a specific size. <em>size</em> is the new size, in
units given by <em>sizeUnits</em>, which is a BannerSizeXxx constant.
<em>isAdvisory</em> is true or nil; if true, it indicates that the size
setting is only an estimate, and that a call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sizeToContents()</code> will be made later; in this
case, the interpreter might simply ignore this estimated size setting
entirely, to avoid unnecessary redrawing. Platforms that do not
support contents-based sizing will always set the estimated size, even
when <em>isAdvisory</em> is true. If <em>isAdvisory</em> is nil, the platform will
set the banner size as requested; set <em>isAdvisory</em> to nil when you
will not follow up with a call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sizeToContents()</code>. If the banner is inactive,
calling this method will be ignored.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**sizeToContents()**</code>: Size the banner to its
current contents. Note that some systems do not support this
operation, so callers should always make an advisory call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setSize()</code> first to set a size based on the
expected content size. If this method is called on an inactive
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> it is simply ignored.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**updateContents(*txt, \[clear\]*)**</code>: update
the contents of the banner with <em>txt</em>, i.e. have the banner display
the string passed in the <em>txt</em> argument and store it in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">currentContents</code> property. This is the method
you should normally call when you want to display content in a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code>. This method optionally
takes a second argument, which should be
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>; if
present this argument overrides the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clearBeforeUpdate</code> setting to force the
window to be cleared before displaying the new contents (if
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>) or else not to (if
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the methods and properties listed above should provide a
reasonably trouble-free interface to the TADS 3 banner implementation,
provided that you keep the following points in mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Always take care over parent/child/sibling dependencies between
banner windows, especially if your banner layout changes dynamically
during the course of your game.</li>
  <li>Treat establishing the banner <em>layout</em> as a separate exercise from
initializing the banner <em>content</em>.</li>
  <li>If your game is at all likely to be played on an interpreter for
which you’ve disabled all or part of your banner layout, either make
sure that being able to play the game doesn’t depend on what would
have been displayed in the unseen banners, or else provide an
alternative means of conveying the same information when the game is
played on an interpreter that lacks the capabilities your banner
needs.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are other methods and properties that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> either defines or inherits
from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BannerWindow</code>, but for the most part these
are used internally by the library and you won’t need to worry about
them (although of course there can always be special cases that may
require you to delve deeper). There are also a number of inherited
methods such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setOutputStream()</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">captureOutput(func)</code>, and the methods specific
to text grid windows that you can use, but which
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomBannerWindow</code> provides only partial
support for, in that a RESTORE or UNDO will not automatically return
what’s displayed in a window to the result of the output from these
methods.</p>
