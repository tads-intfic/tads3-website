<h1 id="scenes">Scenes</h1>

<p>The scenes.t module is used to implement Scenes, which are somewhat
similar to their Inform 7 counterpart. A Scene is mainly a way of
checking whether a particular phase of your interactive story is
currently in progress or has already occurred, and can be used to
control how some other aspects of the game work (for example a
<a href="doer">Doer</a> can be conditional on a certain scene being in progress).
To set up a scene, simply define an object of class <strong>Scene</strong> with the
following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>startsWhen</strong>: an expression or method that evaluates to true when
you want the scene to start.</li>
  <li><strong>endsWhen</strong>: an expression or method that evaluates to something
other than nil when you want the scene to end. Often you would simply
make this return true when you want the scene to end, but if you
wanted to note different kinds of scene ending you could return some
other value (which could be a number, a single-quoted string, an enum
or an object) to represent how the scene ends.</li>
  <li><strong>recurring</strong>: Normally a scene will only occur once. Set recurring to
true if you want the scene to start again every time its startsWhen
condition is true.</li>
  <li><strong>whenStarting</strong>: A method that executes when the scene starts; you
can use it to define what happens at the start of the scene.</li>
  <li><strong>whenEnding</strong>: A method that executes when the scene ends; you can
use it to define what happens at the end of the scene.</li>
  <li><strong>eachTurn</strong>: A method that executes every turn that the scene is
active.</li>
  <li><strong>beforeAction</strong>: A method that executes on every active scene just
before an action is about to take place. This method can veto the
action with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> macro.</li>
  <li><strong>afterAction</strong>: A method that executes on every active scene just
after an action has taken place (and so can be used to provide an
appropriate response to the action during the scene).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition your code can query the following properties of a Scene
object (which should be treated as read-only by game-code since they’re
updated by library code):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>isHappening</strong>: Flag (true or nil) to indicate whether this scene is
currently taking place.</li>
  <li><strong>hasHappened</strong>: Flag (true or nil) to indicate whether this scene has
ever happened (and ended).</li>
  <li><strong>startedAt</strong>: The turn number at which this scene started (or nil if
this scene is yet to happen).</li>
  <li><strong>endedAt</strong>: The turn number at which this scene ended (or nil if this
scene is yet to end).</li>
  <li><strong>timesHappened</strong>: The number of times this scene has happened.</li>
  <li><strong>howEnded</strong>: An optional author-defined flag indicating how the scene
ended (this could be a number, a single-quoted string, an enum or an
object).</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>howEnded</strong> property perhaps deserves a further word of
explanation. You can use this more or less how you like, but one coding
pattern might be to use custom objects to represent different endings
and then make use of the methods and properties of your custom objects.
For example, suppose a certain scene ends tragically if Martha is dead
but happily if you give Martha the gold ring, you might do something
like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class SceneEnding: object
       whenEnding() { }
    ;

    happyEnding: SceneEnding
       whenEnding() { "A surge of happiness washes over you..."; }
    ;

    tragicEnding: SceneEnding
       whenEnding() { "You feel inconsolable at your loss..."; }
    ;

    marthaScene: Scene
       startsWhen = Q.canSee(me, martha)
       
       endsWhen()
       {
            if(martha.isDead)
               return tragicEnding;
             
            if(goldRing.isIn(martha))
               return happyEnding;
             
            return nil;      
       }
       
       whenEnding() 
       {
          if(howEnded != nil)
             howEnded.whenEnding();
       }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One special point to note: if you define the startsWhen condition of a
Scene so that it is true right at the start of play (e.g.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">startsWhen = true</code>), the Scene will indeed
start out active, but its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">whenStarting()</code>
method will execute just <em>after</em> the first room description is
displayed. If you want it to display something just after, you can use
its whenStarting method to display some text, e.g.:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     introScene: Scene
        startsWhen = (harry.isIn(harrysBed))
        endsWhen = (!harry.isIn(harrysBed))
        
        
        whenEnding()
        {
            "Harry stretches and yawns, before staggering uncertainly across the
            room. ";
        }
       
        whenStarting = "Harry groans. "    
    ;
     
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is normally what you would want, but note that this means that you
can’t use a Scene to display any text prior to the first room
description. For that purpose you need to use an
<a href="beginning.html#tenses">InitObject</a> or the showIntro() method of
<a href="beginning.html#gamemain">gameMain</a>.</p>

<h2>Keeping Track of</h2>
<p><span id="time_idx">Time</span></p>

<p>In a sense, Scenes can be said to divide your game into different times
just as Rooms and Regions divide it into different places, but Scenes
don’t actually keep track of time (in the sense of the date or the time
of day). If your game needs to do this you may want to look at either
the <a href="../../extensions/docs/subtime.html">Subjective Time</a> extensions or
the <a href="../../extensions/docs/objtime.html">Objective Time</a> extension. The
first of these allows you to define the time at which certain events
(which could well include the beginning and end of certain Scenes)
occur. If the player character then occasionally consults a clock or
watch, the subjective time extension can then report a suitable time of
day (based on the number of terms elapsed since the last event, the time
attached to the next event, and a number of other factors). This
extension is not suitable, however, if you want a frequent or continuous
display of the time of day (in the status line, for example); for that
purpose you should use the objective time extension which advances the
clock by so many seconds per turn (the actual number of seconds can be
customized in as fine a grained manner as you wish, e.g. to differ for
different actions).</p>
