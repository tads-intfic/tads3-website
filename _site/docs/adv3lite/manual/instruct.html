<h1 id="instructions">Instructions</h1>

<p>The Instructions module (instruct.t) is located under the English
directory, since it is specific to the English-language version of the
library. Its function is to provide players of your game with a set of
general instructions for playing interactive fiction, which may be read
in response to an INTRUCTIONS command (to which you’ll probably want to
call your players’ attention in your introductory text or via your ABOUT
text).</p>

<p>If you have the menu modules included in your game (menusys.t and
menucon.t or menuweb.t), you’ll probably want the instructions to be
shown in menu form rather than as a continuous block of text. To to this
you need to define <span id="ins_menu_idx">INSTRUCTIONS_MENU</span>,
either by adding -D INSTRUCTIONS_MENU as a command line option if you
use t3Make from the command line, or else by adding INSTRUCTIONS_MENU to
the list of symbols to #define in Worbench. To to this in Workbench
select Build -&gt; Settings from the menu, then select “Defines” under the
“Compiler” section on the left-hand side of the dialog box, then click
Add, type INSTRUCTIONS_MENU in the “Macro Name” box, leave “Expansion”
blank and click OK, then click OK again. You’ll probably then need to do
a full recompile for debugging to force a recompile of instruct.t.</p>

<p>The Instructions module makes some attempt to be context-sensitive about
the instructions it provides; for example it won’t describe the GO TO
command if the pathfind module isn’t present, and it won’t talk about
SpecialTopics if none have been defined in your game. In addition, you
can override a number of properties of the Instructions object to
customize what is shown to the player:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>allRequiredVerbsDisclosed</strong>: This property tells us how complete the
verb list is. By default, we’ll assume that the instructions fail to
disclose every required verb in the game, because the generic set we
use here doesn’t even try to anticipate the special verbs that most
games include. If you provide your own list of game-specific verbs,
and your custom list (taken together with the generic list) discloses
every verb required to complete the game, you should set this property
to true; if you set this to true, the instructions will assure the
player that they will not need to think of any verbs besides the ones
listed in the instructions. Authors are strongly encouraged to
disclose a list of verbs that is sufficient by itself to complete the
game, and to set this property to true once they’ve done so.</li>
  <li><span id="custverbs"></span><strong>customVerbs</strong>: A list of custom verbs.
Each game should set this to a list of single-quoted strings; each
string gives an example of a verb to display in the list of sample
verbs. Something like this: customVerbs = [‘brush my teeth’, ‘pick
the lock’]</li>
  <li><strong>conversationVerbs</strong>: Verbs relating specifically to character
interaction. This is in the same format as customVerbs, and has
essentially the same purpose; however, we call these out separately to
allow each game not only to supplement the default list we provide but
to replace our default list. This is desirable for
conversation-related commands in particular because some games will
not use the ASK/TELL conversation system at all and will thus want to
remove any mention of the standard set of verbs.</li>
  <li><strong>conversationAbbr</strong>: A double quoted string explaining the
abbreviations that can be used for conversation verbs, e.g. (as
defined by default) “\n\tASK ABOUT (topic) can be abbreviated to A
(topic) \n\tTELL ABOUT (topic) can be entered as T (topic)”</li>
  <li><strong>truncationLength</strong>: Truncation length. If the game’s parser allows
words to be abbreviated to some minimum number of letters, this should
indicate the minimum length. The English parser uses a truncation
length of 8 letters by default. Set this to nil if the game doesn’t
allow truncation at all.</li>
  <li><span id="cruelty"></span><strong>crueltyLevel</strong>: This property should be
set on a game-by-game basis to indicate the “cruelty level” of the
game, which is a rough estimation of how likely it is that the player
will encounter an unwinnable position in the game.
    <ul>
      <li>Level 0 is “kind,” which means that the player character can never
be killed, and it’s impossible to make the game unwinnable. When
this setting is used, the instructions will reassure the player that
saving is necessary only to suspend the session.</li>
      <li>Level 1 is “standard,” which means that the player character can be
killed, and/or that unwinnable positions are possible, but that
there are no especially bad unwinnable situations. When this setting
is selected, we’ll warn the player that they should save every so
often.</li>
      <li>(An “especially bad” situation is one in which the game becomes
unwinnable at some point, but this won’t become apparent to the
player until much later. For example, suppose the first scene takes
place in a location that can never be reached again after the first
scene, and suppose that there’s some object you can obtain in this
scene. This object will be required in the very last scene to win
the game; if you don’t have the object, you can’t win. This is an
“especially bad” unwinnable situation: if you leave the first scene
without getting the necessary object, the game is unwinnable from
that point forward. In order to win, you have to go back and play
almost the whole game over again. Saved positions are almost useless
in a case like this, since most of the saved positions will be after
the fatal mistake; no matter how often you saved, you’ll still have
to go back and do everything over again from near the beginning.)</li>
      <li>Level 2 is “cruel,” which means that the game can become unwinnable
in especially bad ways, as described above. If this level is
selected, we’ll warn the player more sternly to save frequently.</li>
      <li>We set this to 1 (“standard”) by default, because even games that
aren’t intentionally designed to be cruel often have subtle
situations where the game becomes unwinnable, because of things like
the irreversible loss of an object, or an unrepeatable event
sequence; it almost always takes extra design work to ensure that a
game is always winnable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
