data-“=”“&gt;Adv3Lite Quick Start Guide&lt;/a&gt;<br />
by Eric Eve</p>

<p>This brief guide is probably the best place to start for newcomers to
TADS 3 and/or adv3Lite. It contains instructions for installing the
library and compiling a basic game, an explanation of the other
documentation, including guidance on where to go next, and a sample game
newcomers can experiment with if they want to dive straight in.</p>

Tutorial</a><br />
by Eric Eve</p>

<p>This tutorial introduction is a great starting point for anyone new to
TADS 3 and new to programming. The book opens with the basics of getting
TADS working on your system and setting up your first simple game, so
even if you’ve never done any programming before, this will help you get
going quickly. The tutorial then leads you step by step through the
design of three example games, showing how to use adv3Lite to implement
the effects needed in the game. By the time you’re done, you’ll know
your way around the system and you’ll be able to write your own games.</p>

by Eric Eve</p>

<p>Part tutorial and part reference, <em>Learning TADS 3 With Adv3Lite</em> is a
perfect place to start for confident beginners, and for people with a
little more programming experience. This book is designed for learning
TADS on your terms - it’s organized by functional area, so once you’ve
mastered the basics, you can skip around to focus on the areas you’re
most interested in. As you develop your game, you can return to the book
as a reference, to review the details of particular TADS features.</p>

<p><em>Learning TADS 3 With Adv3Lite</em> contains a number of exercises. Samples
games suggesting solutions to some of these exercises may be found
<a href="learning/exercises.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Alternatively
you can treat these solutions as sample code illustrating various
aspects of the adv3Lite library.</p>

<p>This book is a reference to the TADS 3 language and the T3 VM, including
the standard intrinsic functions and classes. It covers the language and
VM features in depth, so it’s the place to go when you need to find the
details on the system.</p>

by Michael Roberts</p>

<p>TADS 3 uses a variant of HTML as its formatting language. These notes
explain how HTML fits into TADS, and how you can use HTML formatting
codes for text effects, graphics, and sound, and how the TADS variant
differs from standard HTML. (These are essentially just the original
notes for HTML TADS 2, so they’re a little rough, but they are updated
with relevant changes for TADS 3. Note that this isn’t an HTML
tutorial - but the HTML in TADS is pretty close to standard HTML, so you
can learn it from any of the many tutorials on the Web for ordinary
HTML.)</p>
