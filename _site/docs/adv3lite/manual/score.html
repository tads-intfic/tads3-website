<h1 id="scoring">Scoring</h1>

<p>The score.t implements a scoring system that is identical to that in the
adv3 library (and uses exactly the same code). If your game doesn’t use
scoring, exclude the score.t module from your build.</p>

<p>The quick and dirty way to keep score is to use the
<strong>addToScore(<em>points</em>, <em>desc</em>)</strong> function to add points to the player’s
total score along with a description of what you’re awarding points for.
A cleaner and more secure way (secure, for example, in that it makes it
easier to ensure you don’t keep awarding point for the same deed) is to
use <strong>Achievement</strong> objects.</p>

<p>An Achievement is an object used to award points in the score. For most
purposes, an achievement can be described simply by a string, but the
Achievement object provides more flexibility in describing combined
scores when a set of similar achievements are to be grouped.</p>

<p>There are two ways to use the scoring system.</p>

<p>You can use a mix of string names and Achievement objects for scoring
items; each time you award a scoring item, you call the function
addToScore(<em>points</em>, <em>desc</em>) to specify the achievement (by name or by
Achievement object) and the number of points to award. You can also call
the method addToScoreOnce() on an Achievement object to award the
scoring item, ensuring that the item is only awarded once in the entire
game (saving you the trouble of checking to see if the event that
triggered the scoring item has happened before already in the same
game). If you do this, you MUST set the property gameMain.maxScore to
reflect the maximum score possible in the game.</p>

<p>You can use EXCLUSIVELY Achievement objects to represents scoring items,
and give each Achievement object a ‘points’ property indicating the
number of points it’s worth. To award a scoring item, you call the
method awardPoints() on an Achievement object. If you use this style of
scoring, the library AUTOMATICALLY computes the gameMain.maxScore value,
by adding up the ‘points’ values of all of the Achievement objects in
the game. For this to work properly, you have to obey the following
rules:</p>

<p>use ONLY Achievement objects (never strings) to award points;</p>

<p>set the ‘points’ property of each Achievement to its score;</p>

<p>define Achievement objects statically only (never use ‘new’ to create an
Achievement dynamically)</p>

<p>if an Achievement can be awarded more than once, you must override its
‘maxPoints’ property to reflect the total number of points it will be
worth when it is awarded the maximum number of times;</p>

<p>always award an Achievement through its awardPoints() or
awardPointsOnce() method;</p>

<p>there exists at least one solution of the game in which every
Achievement object is awarded</p>

<p>If there is more than one route through your game, it may be a bit
tricky using the second of these approaches. One possible workaround is
to use method 2 for the main route through your game (which you count as
the ‘main’ route may, of course, be an arbitrary choice: you could
choose the longest route, the shortest route, the most interesting route
or anything else that makes sense to you). Then use Achievement objects
for the other routes but call their <strong>addToScoreOnce(<em>points</em>)</strong> method
instead of awardPoints() or awardPointsOnce() if they’re not on the main
route; and don’t define their points property. That way the points from
these additional off-the-main-route Achievements won’t be included the
calculation of the maximum available points.</p>
