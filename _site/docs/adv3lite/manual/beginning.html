<h1 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h1>

<p>A work of Interactive Fiction has to start somewhere, and preferably
with something a little more informative than a blank screen with a
command prompt. In any case, for the game to work properly you need to
define at least a basic set of data about the game and some of its
starting conditions. We saw a brief example of this in the section on
defining a <a href="mingame.html">minimal game</a>, but now we should cover the
topic a little more formally and in more depth.</p>

<h2 id="the-versioninfo-object"><span id="versioninfo">The versionInfo Object</span></h2>

<p>Your game should normally define a versionInfo object (of the GameID
class) to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Specify basic information about your game (its name, author, etc.)</li>
  <li>Define the response to informational commands like ABOUT and
CREDITS.</li>
</ol>

<p>The properties and methods of versionInfo you’ll typically need to
define are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>IFID</strong>: a random 32-digit hex number to uniquely identify the game;
you can generate one at <a href="http://www.tads.org/ifidgen/ifidgen">http://www.tads.org/ifidgen/ifidgen</a></li>
  <li><strong>name</strong>: The name of your game, e.g. ‘Amazing Quest’</li>
  <li><strong>byline</strong>: Your name or pseudonym, e.g. ‘by I.F. Author’</li>
  <li><strong>htmlByline</strong>: the main author credit as an HTML fragment</li>
  <li><strong>authorEmail</strong>: the authors’ names and email addresses (in GameInfo
format) (e.g. ‘I.F.Author &lt;i.author@whatevermail.com&gt;’)</li>
  <li><strong>desc</strong>: a short blurb describing the game, in plain text format</li>
  <li><strong>htmlDesc</strong>: the descriptive blurb as an HTML fragment</li>
  <li><strong>version</strong>:the game’s version number string</li>
  <li><strong>showAbout()</strong>: the method to run in response to an ABOUT command.</li>
  <li><strong>showCredit()</strong>: the method to run in response to a CREDITS command.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, for example, a typical versionInfo definition might look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    versionInfo: GameID
        IFID = '0D9D2F69-90D5-4BDA-A21F-5B64C878D0AB'
        name = 'Fire!'
        byline = 'by Eric Eve'
        htmlByline = 'by &lt;a href="mailto:eric.eve@nospam.com"&gt;
                      Eric Eve&lt;/a&gt;'
        version = '1'
        authorEmail = 'Eric Eve &lt;eric.eve@nospam.com&gt;'
        desc = 'A test game for the adv3lite library.'
        htmlDesc = 'A test game for the adv3lite library.'
        
        showAbout()
        {
            aboutMenu.display();
            
            "This is a demonstration/test game for the adv3Lite library. It should
            be possible to reach a winning solution using a basic subset of common
            IF commands.&lt;.p&gt;";
        }
        
        showCredit()
        {
            "Fire! by Eric Eve\b
            adv3Lite library by Eric Eve with substantial chunks borrowed from the
            Mercury and adv3 libraries by Mike Roberts. ";               
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition, you can override the following settings if you don’t like
the defaults inherited from GameInfoModuleID:</p>

<ul>
  <li>releaseDate - the release date string (YYYY-MM-DD)</li>
  <li>licenseType - freeware, shareware, etc.</li>
  <li>copyingRules - summary rules on copying</li>
  <li>presentationProfile - Multimedia, Plain Text</li>
</ul>

<p>For further details consult the comments on the GameInfoModuleID in the
modid.t file and/or consult the article on “Bibliographical Metadata” in
the <em>TADS 3 Technical Manual</em> (although this was written for the adv3
library, everything in the Metadata article should apply equally well to
adv3Lite).</p>

<h2 id="the-gamemain-object"><span id="gamemain">The gameMain Object</span></h2>

<p>You game must define a gameMain object, which should be of the
GameMainDef class. At a basic minimum it must define the
<strong>initialPlayerChar</strong> property to identify the object that is to
represent the player character at the start of the game (typically this
is called me, though you can call it anything you like). A minimal
gameMain definition will therefore look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    gameMain: GameMainDef
       initialPlayerChar = me
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In practice you’ll normally want to define rather more than this on your
gameMain object. The other properties and methods you may want to define
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>showIntro()</strong>: Show the game’s introduction. This routine is called
by the default newGame() just before entering the main command loop.
The command loop starts off by showing the initial room description,so
there’s no need to do that here. Most games will want to override
this, to show a prologue message setting up the game’s initial
situation for the player.</li>
  <li><strong>showGoodbye()</strong>: Show the “goodbye” message. This is called after
the main command loop terminates. It doesn’t show anything by default.
If you want to show a “thanks for playing” type of message as the game
exits, override this routine with the desired text.</li>
  <li><strong>setAboutBox</strong>(): Define how the about box should appear (typically
in response to selecting Help, About from the menu of an HTML TADS
interpreter. For more details on how to do this see the notes
<a href="#aboutbox">below</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>maxScore()</strong>: The maximum number of points possible in the game. If
the game includes the <a href="score.html">scoring module</a> at all, and this is
non-nil, the SCORE and FULL SCORE commands will display this value to
the player as a rough indication of how much farther there is to go in
the game. By default, the library initializes this on demand, by
calculating the sum of the point values of the Achievement objects in
the game. The game can override this if needed to specify a specific
maximum possible score, rather than relying on the automatic
calculation.</li>
  <li><strong>beforeRunsBeforeCheck</strong>: Should the “<a href="react.html">before</a>”
notifications (beforeAction and roomBeforeAction) run before or after
the “check” phase? The adv3 library traditionally ran the “before”
notifiers first, but the adv3Lite runs the “before” notifiers after
the check phase, so in the adv3Lite library the default value is nil.
In many ways it’s more logical and useful to run “check” first. That
way, you can consider the action to be more or less committed by the
time the “before” notifiers are invoked. Of course, a command is never
<em>truly</em> committed until it’s actually been executed, since a “before”
handler could always cancel it. But this is relatively rare - “before”
handlers usually carry out side effects, so it’s very useful to be
able to know that the command has already passed all of its own
internal checks by the time “before” is invoked - that way, you can
invoke side effects without worrying that the command will
subsequently fail.</li>
  <li><strong>usePastTense</strong>: This can be set to true if you want your game to be
narrated in the past tense (it has the effect of making all the
library messages appear in the past tense). If it’s left at nil, the
default, the game will be narrated in the present tense. The adv3Lite
library, courtesy of the Mercury code it inherits, is actually capable
of narration in six different tenses, but the present and the past are
the ones most likely to be use in at least 99% of games. If you want
to use one of the other tenses see notes <a href="#tenses">below</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>allVerbsAllowAll</strong>: This can be set to nil to prevent the player
using ALL (e.g. EXAMINE ALL) with all but a handful of
inventory-handling verbs (TAKE, DROP, PUT and DOFF), since some game
authors may feel that allowing ALL with every verb allows a
sledge-hammer approach to their games. The default value is true.</li>
  <li><strong>useParentheticalListing</strong>: If this flag is true (the default is nil)
then room description listings and examine listings use a
parenthetical style to show subcontents (e.g. “On the table you see a
box (in which is a brass key)”) instead of showing each item and its
contents in a separate paragraph.</li>
  <li><strong>paraBrksBtwnSubcontents</strong>: If this flag is true (the default) then
room description listings will include a paragraph break between each
set of subcontents listings (i.e. the listing of the contents of each
item in the room that has visible contents). If it is nil the
subcontents listings will all be run into a single paragraph. Note
that the global setting defined here can be overridden on individual
rooms.</li>
  <li><strong>againRepeatsParse</strong>: This controls how the AGAIN command is
interpreted. It is nil (the default, representing the previous
behaviour of adv3Lite), AGAIN repeats the resolved command, that is,
the command as it was interpreted on the previous turn, with the same
objects. If it is true, then the text of the previous command is
reparsed, which may result in a different interpretation involving
different objects. For example, suppose there are two coins on the
floor. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">againRepeatsParse</code> is nil then TAKE
COIN followed by AGAIN will result in one of the coins being taken,
followed by an attempt to take the <em>same coin</em> again (which will fail
with a message that you’re already holding the coin). If
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">againRepeatsParse</code> is true, however, than
TAKE COIN followed by AGAIN will result in one coin being taken, and
then the other, just as if the player had typed TAKE COIN twice. Which
is the better behaviour depends on context; while in the coin example
the second interpretation seems better, if a player were to type
EXAMINE BOOK and be prompted to say which one, the second
interpretation would result in the disambiguation prompt being
repeated, which might seem perverse.</li>
  <li><strong>autoSwitchAgain</strong>: this tries to give the player the best of both
worlds by switching <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">againRepeatsParse</code>
between true and nil depending on whether the command to be repeated
is the kind of command it would make sense to repeat with the same
objects (if it isn’t, the command is reparsed in the hope of finding a
more sensible match). This is far from absolutely foolproof, and
should be regarded as experimental. It is true (switched on) by
default, but game authors may wish to set it to nil if it proves
troublesome.</li>
  <li><strong>verbose</strong>: flag - is this game in verbose mode (full room
descriptions are shown every time) or in brief mode (full room
descriptions are shown only on the first visit or in response to an
explicit LOOK command). By default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verbose</code>
is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>, but players can change it using the
commands BRIEF and VERBOSE.</li>
  <li><strong>fastGoTo</strong>. By default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastGoTo</code> is nil,
but if it is set to true then the <a href="pathfind.html">GO TO</a> command will
move the player character continuously to his/her destination (unless
some obstacle stops the journey) without the player needing to use the
CONTINUE command.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you look at the definition of GameMainDef in misc.t you’ll see a
number of other methods and properties. Some of these, such as
newGame(), restoreAndRunGame(filename), setGameTitle() and
getSaveDesc(userDesc) are probably left as the library defines them
unless you really have a need to override them and you know what you’re
doing. The rest are not guaranteed to work in the current version of the
adv3Lite library and are probably best left alone (they have been left
in from the adv3 version of GameMainDef for possible implementation in a
later version of adv3Lite).</p>

<p>A fairly typical gameMain definition might thus look something like
this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    gameMain: GameMainDef
        initialPlayerChar = me
        
        showIntro()
        {       
            cls();
                            
            george.startFollowing;
            
            "&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='red'&gt;FIRE!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  You woke up just now, choking
                from the smoke that was already starting to fill your bedroom,
                threw something on and hurried downstairs -- narrowly missing
                tripping over the beach ball so thoughtgfully left on the landing
                by your &lt;i&gt;dear&lt;/i&gt; nephew Jason -- you &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; having him to
                stay yesterday would be trouble -- perhaps he's even responsible
                for the fire (not that he's around any more to blame -- that's one
                less thing to worry about anyway).\b
                So, here you are, in the hall, all ready to dash out of the house
                before it burns down around you. There's just one problem: in your
                hurry to get downstairs you left your front door key in your
                bedroom.&lt;.p&gt;";
        }
       
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="notes"></span></p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>When defining a <strong><span id="aboutbox">showAboutBox()</span></strong> method
you’d typically make it display a string beginning and ending with the
&lt;ABOUTBOX&gt; and &lt;/ABOUTBOX&gt; tags. A very basic setAboutBox() method
that picks up all the relevant text from the versionInfo object might
look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      setAboutBox()
        {
            "&lt;ABOUTBOX&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;FONT size=+2 color=red&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;&lt;versionInfo.name&gt;&gt;
            &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\b
             &lt;&lt;versionInfo.byline&gt;&gt;\b
            Version &lt;&lt;versionInfo.version&gt;&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/ABOUTBOX&gt;";
        }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For <span id="tenses"><strong>tenses</strong></span> other than past or present,
override <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Narrator.tense</code> to be one of Present
(‘Bob opens the box’), Past (‘Bob opened the box’), Perfect (‘Bob has
opened the box’), PastPerfect (‘Bob had opened the box’), Future (‘Bob
will open the box’), or FuturePefect (‘Bob will have opened the box’).
By default the library defines Narrator.tense as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(gameMain.usePastTense ? Past : Present)</code>.</p>

<p>The <strong>showIntro()</strong> method is primarily for showing the game’s
introduction. It may also be a convenient place to put small amounts of
start-up code used for initializing the game state (such as starting a
Daemon running), but for initialization code you should also consider
using <strong>PreinitObject</strong> and <strong>InitObject</strong>, which are definined in the
System Library, and which you can read about in the “Program
Initialization” section of the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em>.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-player-character"><span id="definingpc">Defining the Player Character</span></h2>

<p>Every TADS 3 game written with the adv3Lite library must define one
object to be the player character (the character from whose viewpoint
the game is played). It is possible to <a href="changepc.html">change the player
character</a> in the course of play, although many if not
most games will probably stick to the same player character throughout;
in any case a game must define which object is the player character at
the start of play, in other words, the initial player character. If you
do plan to change the player character during the course of the game, it
is probably best to define every object that is going to represent the
player character at one time or another as an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Actor</code>, especially if the different player
characters are going to encounter each other. Otherwise, the player
character can perfectly well be defined as a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thing</code> or as a <strong>Player</strong> object, although
provided the actor.t module is present in the build, it is always okay
to define the player character as an Actor object. Which Actor, Thing or
Player object represents the initial player character can be defined
either by setting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initialPlayerChar</code>
property on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gameMain</code> object, or by setting
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isInitialPlayerChar = true</code> on the object in
question. If both are done, the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initialPlayerChar</code> object defined on the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gameMain</code> object will take precedence.</p>

<p>To unpack that somewhat terse summary, we may begin by noting that if
you create a new adv3Lite new game using the new Project Wizard in TADS
3 Workbench, the Wizard will create a minimal template game that does
all this work for you thus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    #charset "us-ascii"

    #include &lt;tads.h&gt;
    #include "advlite.h"

    versionInfo: GameID
        IFID = '$IFID$'
        name = '$TITLE$'
        byline = 'by $AUTHOR$'
        htmlByline = 'by &lt;a href="mailto:$EMAIL$"&gt;$AUTHOR$&lt;/a&gt;'
        version = '1'
        authorEmail = '$AUTHOR$ &lt;$EMAIL$&gt;'
        desc = '$DESC$'
        htmlDesc = '$HTMLDESC$'
    ;

    gameMain: GameMainDef
        /* Define the initial player character; this is compulsory */
        initialPlayerChar = me
    ;


    /* The starting location; this can be called anything you like */

    startroom: Room 'The Starting Location'
        "Add your description here. "
    ;

    /* 
     *   The player character object. This doesn't have to be called me, but me is a
     *   convenient name. If you change it to something else, rememember to change
     *   gameMain.initialPlayerChar accordingly.
     */

    + me: Thing 'you'   
        isFixed = true       
        person = 2  // change to 1 for a first-person game
        contType = Carrier    
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Except that the versionInfo object will be filled in with the data you
entered in the wizard. This way of declaring the initial player
character has a couple of advantages: (1) it makes it clear just by
looking at the gameMain object which object is the initial player
character (you don’t have to go hunting for it further down in the
source code; (2) it makes it clear that the player character object is
simply a Thing with a few extra properties set and in particular (3) it
calls attention to the <strong>person</strong> property which you may want to change
for a first-person or third-person game. If you’ve created a new game
via the Workbench wizard this has no real downside, since the wizard
will have done virtually all the work for you.</p>

<p>If you are starting a new game without using the wizard (perhaps because
you aren’t using Workbench) you can save yourself a small amount of
typing by using the Player class instead of the Thing class to define
the player character object:</p>

<p>```
    #charset “us-ascii”</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#include &lt;tads.h&gt;
#include "advlite.h"

versionInfo: GameID
    IFID = '$IFID$'
    name = 'My Game'
    byline = 'by My name'
    htmlByline = 'by &lt;a href="mailto:$EMAIL$"&gt;$AUTHOR$&lt;/a&gt;'
    version = '1'
    authorEmail = 'my.name@myemail.org'
    desc = 'My blurb'
    htmlDesc = 'My html blurb'
;

gameMain: GameMainDef
    /* We don't now have to define the initial player character here */    
;


/* The starting location; this can be called anything you like */

startroom: Room 'The Starting Location'
    "Add your description here. "
;

/* 
 *   The player character object. This doesn't have to be called me, but me is a
 *   convenient name. The Player class registers this object as the player character
 *   so you don't need to set gameMain.initialPlayerChar accordingly.
 */

+ me: Player 'you'       
;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This isn’t a lot less typing, but you may feel it looks a bit neater and
makes it clearer which object is the player character. In terms of what
it does, it’s effectively identical to the first way of doing things.</p>

<p>Finally, as an alternative to both these ways of defining the player
character, you can define it as an Actor (provided actor.t is present in
your game build), and either define
```isInitialPlayerChar = true<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> on that player
character Actor or define
</code>gameMain.initialPlayerChar` to point to it.
None of these ways of doing it is intrinsically better to any other
(unless you plan to switch the player character in the course of the
game, in which case using the Actor class may be your best choice), so
which way you do it is simply a matter of personal preference.</p>

<p>Whichever way you choose to define your player character object, you
will probably want to customize it at least to the extent of defining
its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desc</code> property so that your players see a
customized response to X ME.</p>
