<h1 id="player-character-and-npc-knowledge">Player Character and NPC Knowledge</h1>

<p>One type of condition that clearly effects what conversation topics
should be available at any point in time is what the player character,
and possibly the NPC s/he’s conversing with, knows at that point in
time. For example the player character can’t ask Bob about the dark
tower until the player character knows such a thing exists (even if the
player knows it because s/he’s played the game before). In this section
we look at how to keep track of what the player character and other
characters know, and how to use that information to affect what
conversation topics are available at any point in time.</p>

<p><a href="model"></a></p>

<h2 id="the-knowledge-model">The Knowledge Model</h2>

<p>The adv3lite knowledge model starts from the premise that the player
character knows of the existence of an object either if s/he has seen
it, or if we declare it to be <strong>familiar</strong>. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">familiar</code> property is a way of telling the game
that the player character knows about (i.e. knows of the existence of)
an object even is s/he hasn’t seen it (or hasn’t seen it yet). This
allows the player to ask or tell other characters about this object.</p>

<p>The library attempts to keep track of what the player character has seen
by setting the <strong>seen</strong> property of objects to true once the player
character has seen them. In some cases, however, a game author may have
to do this manually, for example when moving an object into view using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moveInto()</code>. For reasons that will become more
apparent below, rather than setting the value of the seen property
manually, it’s often best not to do so directly (which a statement like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codebook.seen = true</code>) but either by calling
the <strong>setSeen()</strong> method on the object that has just come into view
(e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codebook.setSeen()</code>) or calling
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setHasSeen(obj)</code> on the player character (e.g.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gPlayerChar.setHasSeen(codebook)</code>). The second
method can be abbreviated by using the <strong>gSetSeen()</strong> macro; writing
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gSetSeen(codebook)</code> is exactly equivalent to
writing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gPlayerChar.setHasSeen(codebook)</code>. To
test whether the player character has seen something we can use the
<strong>hasSeen()</strong> method, e.g.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gPlayerChar.hasSeen(codebook)</code> will be true if
the player character has seen the codebook.</p>

<p>In the case of Things (or Topics) the player character learns about
other than by actually seeing them, we use the <strong>familiar</strong> property. If
the player character learns of the existence of a codebook that s/he is
yet to find, we can set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codebook.familiar</code> to
true to indicate that the player character now knows of the codebook’s
existence (and so can refer to it in conversation). Again it’s often
best to do this using either <strong>setKnown()</strong>, e.g.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codeBook.setKnown()</code> or <strong>setKnowsAbout()</strong>,
e.g. gPlayerChar.setKnowsAbout(codebook) which can be abbreviated to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gSetKnown(codebook)</code> using the <strong>gSetKnown()</strong>
macro. Each of these methos will set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codeBook.familiar</code> to true.</p>

<p>Remember, the player character knows about the codebook either if s/he
has seen it (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codebook.seen</code> is true) or if s/he
has learned about its existence in some other way
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codebook.familiar</code> is true). To test whether
the player character knows about the codebook we use the
<strong>knowsAbout()</strong> method, e.g. gPlayerChar.knowsAbout(codebook) or the
known property, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codebook.known</code> (which
simply returns the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gPlayerChar.knowsAbout(codebook)</code>).</p>

<p>At first sight, this may all seem unnecessarily complex; why not just
set and test the values of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seen</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">known</code> directly, and why do we need another
property called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">familiar</code>? To answer the second
question first we need to distinguish <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">familiar</code>
(known about but not necessarily seen) from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">known</code> (either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seen</code>
or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">familiar</code>). Since
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.known</code> is true either if
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.seen</code> is true or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.familiar</code> is true, we need three property
names to keep track of the epistemological model.</p>

<p>In games where we’re only interested in what the player character has
seen and knows about, it would be perfectly okay to set and test the
values of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seen</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">familiar</code> directly. The complication comes in
either when we have more than one player character (because the player
character changes during the course of play) or because we want to keep
separate track of what non-player characters have seen and/or know
about. By themselves the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seen</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">familiar</code> properties of objects don’t tell us
who has seen them or is familiar with them. So if we’re interested in
tracking the knowledge of more than one actor in the game we have to do
a bit more work.</p>

<p>To this end we can use the <strong>seenProp</strong> and <strong>knownProp</strong> properties.
These are defined on the actor concerned, and should contained property
pointers defining which properties of Thing (and Topic) to use to keep
track of what this particular actor has seen and is familiar with. By
default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seenProp</code> is just
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;seen</code> for every actor, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">knownProp</code> is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;familiar</code> for every actor, meaning that
calling setHasSeen(obj) on <em>any</em> actor will set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.seen</code> to true, and calling
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">knowsAbout(obj) </code>on any actor will set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.familiar</code> to true. If, however, we wanted
to keep separate track of Bob’s knowledge we could define new
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bobSeen</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bobFamiliar</code> properties on Thing (and a new
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bobFamiliar</code> property on Topic), and then set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob.seenProp</code> to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;bobSeen</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob.knownProp</code> to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;bobFamiliar</code>, like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify Thing
        bobSeen = nil
        bobFamiliar = nil
    ;

    modify Topic
       bobFamiliar = true // We tend to assume that most topics start out familiar, but we don't have to. 
    ; 

    bob: Actor 'Bob; squat little;fellow man; him'
       "He's a squat little fellow. "
       seenProp = &amp;bobSeen
       knownProp = &amp;bobFamiliar
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With these definitions in place,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob.setHasSeen(obj</code>) will set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.bobSeen</code> to true, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob.setKnowsAbout(obj)</code> will set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.bobFamiliar</code> to true. Likewise,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob.hasSeen(obj)</code> will return the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.bobSeen</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob.knowsAbout(obj)</code> will return the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(obj.bobSeen \|\| obj.bobFamiliar)</code>. Note,
however, that doing all this does <em>not</em> cause the library to keep
automatic track of what Bob has seen; it is still up to the game code to
call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob.setHasSeen(whatever)</code> as and when
appropriate.</p>

<p>If you are certain that your game will <em>never</em> need to keep track of
what anyone other than its player character has seen and knows about
(and your game will only ever have one player character), then it is
safe to set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">familiar</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seen</code> properties of Things and to query the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">known</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seen</code>
properties of Things directly. Otherwise its better to use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setSeen()</code> and the rest from the start to avoid
hard-to-find bugs later.</p>

<p><span id="existence"></span></p>

<h2 id="knowledge-of-existence-in-conversation">Knowledge of Existence in Conversation</h2>

<p>We have already seen that the library keeps basic track of the player
character’s knowledge of the existence of <a href="thing.html">things</a> and
<a href="topic.html">topics</a>. As stated aboved, we can test whether the player
character knows of the existence of some object <em>obj</em> by testing the
value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gPlayerChar.knowsAbout(obj)</code> or,
equivalently, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.known</code>. If obj is a Thing
this will be true either if the player character has seen obj or if the
<strong>familiar</strong> property of obj (i.e. obj.familiar) is true. Since Topics
can’t be seen they’re simply known if they’re familiar. We can make an
object become familiar to the player character during the course of play
by calling <strong>gSetKnown(obj)</strong>. Equivalently, if something becomes known
to the player character during the course of conversation, we can use
the <strong>&lt;.known obj&gt;</strong> tag to do the same thing.</p>

<p>The important thing to bear in mind is that the matchObj property of a
TopicEntry won’t be matched by a conversational command if the object in
question isn’t known to the player character. Thus, without our having
to do anything else about it, the player character can’t ask about the
dark tower, for example, until s/he knows of the dark tower’s existence.
That means we can safely define ActorTopicEntries like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + AskTellTopic @tTown
       "&lt;q&gt;This seems a nice town,&lt;/q&gt; you remark cheerily.\b
        &lt;q&gt;Yes it is -- provided you don't go anywhere the dark
        tower,&lt;/q&gt; he agrees cautiously. &lt;.known darkTower&gt; "
    ;

    + AskTopic @darkTower
      "&lt;q&gt;What can you tell me about the dark tower?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
      Bob rolls his eyes and looks away for a moment. &lt;q&gt;You don't want
      to know,&lt;/q&gt; he mutters. &lt;q&gt;You really don't.&lt;/q&gt; "
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, the second TopicEntry can’t be reached until the player character
knows about (i.e. knows of the existence of) the dark tower. This might
be because the player character has already encountered the tower in his
travels, or because he’s read about it somewhere, or because some other
NPC has mentioned it to him, but if the player character hasn’t heard
about the dark tower before the start of his conversation with Bob, he
won’t be able to trigger the second response until Bob has mentioned the
dark tower in the first.</p>

<p><span id="facts"></span></p>

<h2 id="knowledge-of-facts">Knowledge of Facts</h2>

<p>The player character’s knowledge or ignorance of the existence of
various things and topics may not, however, be sufficient to model all
the epistemic conditions that determine what topics the player character
can talk about. For example, in addition to learning of the dark tower’s
existence, the player character may come to learn when it was built, or
that it’s believed to be haunted by the ghost of a pirate, or that
people are said to have mysteriously disappeared there. To represent
such facts (or putative facts) we can use short string tags, such as
‘when-tower-built’ or ‘tower-haunted’ or ‘tower-disapperances’. For
reasons that will shortly become apparent, we should regard such tags as
inhabiting a global namespace (in other words, we should always use the
same knowledge tag with the same meaning throughout our game).</p>

<p>When a piece of information becomes known to the player character, we
can note the fact by using a <strong>&lt;.reveal&gt;</strong> tag; e.g. &lt;.reveal
when-tower-built&gt; or &lt;.reveal tower-haunted&gt; or &lt;.reveal
tower-disappearances&gt; (we can also do the same thing using the
<strong>gReveal(tag)</strong> macro, e.g. gReveal(‘when-tower-built’)). To test
whether some item of knowledge has been revealed to the player character
we can use the <strong>gRevealed(tag)</strong> macro, e.g.
gRevealed(‘tower-haunted’). So, for example, we might go on to define:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + AskTellTopic +110 @darkTower
       "&lt;q&gt;I've heard it said that the dark tower is haunted,&lt;/q&gt; you remark.
        &lt;q&gt;Do you believe that?&lt;/q&gt;\b
        Bob gives a little shudder. &lt;q&gt;I don't &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; that tower is
        haunted,&lt;/q&gt; he tells you, &lt;q&gt;I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; it is!&lt;/q&gt; "
        
        isActive = gRevealed('tower-haunted')
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we’ve given this AskTellTopic a matchScore of 110 (10 higher
than the default) so that if the player character has heard about the
rumours of haunting he asks this more specific question about the tower
in place of the more general one above.</p>

<p>Some game authors may wish to use this mechanism for other purposes
outside strictly conversational contexts as a convenient method to set
and unset flags. For this purpose the library defines an
<strong>&lt;.unreveal&gt;</strong> tag, which undoes the effect of &lt;.reveal&gt; and a
<strong>gUnreveal(<em>key</em>)</strong> macro which undoes the effect of gReveal(<em>key</em>)
[Strictly speaking, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;.unreveal *key*\&gt;</code> does
not undo all the effects of ` &lt;.reveal key&gt;<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,
it simply removes *key* from, the LookUpTable of stored keys; it doesn't
undo the updating of the informed status of *key* on every NPC in
earshot, since it is unclear that this is what should happen; game code
can override </code>Actor.setUnrevealed(tag)` if it
wants to handle things differently].</p>

<p>At this point we might also note that gReveal(), gUnreveal and
gRevealed() are defined in the core library, so you can use them even if
the actor.t module isn’t present (e.g. for use with the hints system),
whereas the &lt;.reveal&gt; tag, in common with all such converational tags,
only works if actor.t is included in the build.</p>

<p><span id="informed"></span></p>

<p>In the adv3Lite library &lt;.reveal&gt; tags should be regarded as a
mechanism for keeping track of what has been revealed to the player
character. To keep track of what the player character has told one or
more NPCs we use <strong>&lt;.inform&gt;</strong> tags (note, the adv3 library does not
make this distinction, but it seemed a useful distinction to introduce
into adv3Lite), e.g., &lt;.inform tower-haunted&gt;. We can test whether an
NPC has been informed about a particular subject by calling the
<strong>informedAbout(key)</strong> method on the actor, or using the
<strong>gInformed(key)</strong> macro on a TopicEntry, ActorState or AgendaItem
belonging to the actor. For example, if at some later point in the game
the player character were to discuss his experiences in Bob’s town with
a friend, he might want to inform her about the haunting:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + TellTopic @darkTower
      "&lt;q&gt;You know, the folks in Doomsville even think their local tower is
       haunted,&lt;/q&gt; you remark. &lt;.inform tower-haunted&gt;\b
       Mavis shakes her head tut-tutting away to herself. &lt;q&gt;There's no
       end to superstition and folly,&lt;/q&gt; she remarks. &lt;q&gt;Mind you, I heard
       a similar story about Spookhampton.&lt;/q&gt; &lt;.reveal spookhampton-haunted&gt; "
       
      isActive = gRevealed('tower-haunted') &amp;&amp; !gInformed('tower-haunted')
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how we use the gInformed() macro in the isActive property so that
the player character won’t tell Mavis the same piece of information
twice (we might also use it elsewhere). Note how we also use the
gRevealed() macro to ensure that the player character can’t tell Mavis
about the haunting until he knows about it himself. Finally, note that
we use the &lt;.reveal spookhampton-haunted&gt; tag to note that the player
character has just learned another snippet of information about alleged
hauntings.</p>

<p>There’s one further feature of the &lt;.reveal&gt; and &lt;.inform&gt; tags to
bear in mind. The adv3Lite library assumes that if other actors are in
earshot when a conversation is going on between the player character and
an NPC, the other actors will be listening in on the conversation and
hence will learn any piece of information that’s imparted with a
&lt;.reveal&gt; or &lt;.inform&gt; tag. This in fact extends to the NPC the
player character is conversing with as well (though not to the player
character, whose knowledge is accessed entirely though what’s been
revealed). So, for example, if Sally were listening in on the player
character’s conversation with Bob, then a &lt;.reveal tower-haunted&gt; or a
&lt;.inform tower-haunted&gt; tag output in the course of that conversation
would add the ‘tower-haunted’ key to both Bob’s and Sally’s table of
inform keys, so that thereafter both bob.informedAbout(‘tower-haunted’)
and sally.informedAbout(‘tower-haunted’) would return true. This seems
more realistic than supposing that Sally would remain ignorant of the
tower haunting rumours when Bob was discussing them with the player
character right in front of her. It also ensures that Bob is reckoned as
being informed about anything he has revealed to the player character,
which is again surely more realistic than the opposite assumption. Note,
however, that the &lt;.reveal&gt; tag only causes other actors to be
notified of what’s just been revealed if it’s used during the course of
conversation; if it’s used for some other purpose (e.g. to set a flag
when an object is examined), the notifications won’t take place (unless
a conversation happens to be taking place at the same time). If you want
to ensure that no notifications take place, use gReveal(tag) instead.</p>

<p>If you don’t want this ‘overhearing’ behaviour, you can also control it
through use of the <strong>informOverheard</strong> and <strong>actorInformOverheard</strong>
properties. The imparting of information to other actors in earshot can
be prevented by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">informOverheard = nil</code>
on the current interlocutor’s current ActorState, or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actorInformOverheard = nil</code> on the Actor (when
the current ActorState is nil). To prevent the overhearing behaviour
globally, set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">informOverheard = nil</code> on the
actor or on the whole Actor class.</p>

<p>The fact that an information-key revealed to the player character is
always the same information-key that informs one or more NPCs explains
why such keys must be regarded as occupying a global namespace within
any given game (even if that weren’t a good idea in any case to avoid
confusion).</p>
