<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This is now the first “official” (i.e. post-beta) release version of
adv3Lite. By now it should be settling down to be fairly stable, so it
should be eminently safe to write a game in it, even though some bugs
(hopefully relatively obscure ones by now) will doubtless remain.</p>

<p>At this stage it is unlikely that many (if any) features of the library
will be substantially changed in future releases. As far as possible
we’ll try to ensure that everything described in this manual will
continue to work as described, but we can’t absolutely guarantee that
nothing will change, since change may be unavoidable to implement some
new feature or resolve some unanticipated difficulty. Any features of or
code in the library not explicitly covered in this manual are liable to
change without notice. That said, after so many beta releases it is
unlikely that things will change very much.</p>

<p>At the moment adv3Lite is a young project and I have no idea how many
people will be interested in it. So if you have read this far, thank you
for your interest! I hope that the adv3Lite library may be able to serve
some of your IF needs either now or in the future.</p>
