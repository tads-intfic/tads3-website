<h1 id="help-for-new-players">Help for New Players</h1>

<p>Players familiar with Interactive Fiction generally have a good idea
what sort of thing is worth typing at the command prompt. Players new to
IF may be totally unfamiliar with the conventions. They see a command
prompt with the implied promise that it will understand anything they
type at it, and may quickly become frustrated when the game seems to
understand nothing they type but simply responds with a series of
standard parser error messages along the lines of “I don’t understand
you”. This situation can be at least alleviated somewhat by providing
aids to new players.</p>

<p>One such aid is the instructions for playing IF that can be displayed in
response to an <a href="instruct.html">INSTRUCTIONS</a> command. Another is the
<a href="hint.html#extra">ExtraHint</a> mechanism that can provide hints to players
who seem to be getting stuck. The trouble is that many people aren’t all
that good at reading instructions (or at least, all that eager to do so)
and many new players may not be aware that such facilities even exist,
let alone how to get at them. If you include the file newbie.t in your
build, it provides four additional kinds of assistance that will be
displayed below. The newbie.t module is included in the English-specific
part of the library as so much of it is language specific.</p>

<p><span id="helpmsg"></span></p>

<h2 id="the-helpmessage-object">The helpMessage object</h2>

<p>The helpMessage object enables three new commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Help</strong>: this executes helpMessage.printMsg(), which in turn displays
a brief message explaining the use of the INSTRUCTIONS, INTRO, SAMPLE
and HINT commands (provided these are all available in the game).</li>
  <li><strong>Intro</strong>: this executes helpMessage.briefIntro(), which displays a
very brief set of instructions for playing IF, mentioning some of the
most commonly used commands.</li>
  <li><strong>Sample</strong>: this executes helpMessage.showSample(), which shows a
short sample transcript.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t like the text any of these displays, you can modify the
helpMessage object in your own code to override one or more of these
methods. For example, you might want to display a transcript that’s more
relevant to your own game you might do something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify helpMsg
      showSample()
      {
        "A typical game (not this particular one) might start something like
            this:\b";
            inputManager.pauseForMore();
            "&lt;b&gt;&gt;x me&lt;/b&gt;\n
            You're a fearsome dragon, the last of the Galvanax clan.\b
            &lt;b&gt;&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;\n
            Dragons carry nothing but their scales and their claws.\b   
            &lt;b&gt;&gt;fly&lt;/b&gt;\n
            Which way do you want to fly?\b
            &lt;b&gt;&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;\v
            With a great flapping of wings you soar up into the sky...";
            inputManager.pauseForMore();
            "And now back to the game you\'re actually playing....\b";
            gPlayerChar.getOutermostRoom.lookAroundWithin();          
      }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="trapping"></span></p>

<h2 id="trapping-badly-formed-commands">Trapping badly-formed commands</h2>

<p>New players unfamiliar with the form often try to type commands like
WHERE AM I, WHAT DO I DO NOW, PLEASE GO NORTH, or WHAT’S THIS GAME
ABOUT? Such commands may look eminently sensible to the person who types
them, but most IF parsers will simply respond with a “Command not
understood” message, which can make the parser seem stupid and
inflexible to new players (indeed, it’s part of what gives the IF parser
a bad name).</p>

<p>Some time ago Emily Short wrote an Inform 6 extension to handle such
badly-formed commands more gracefully. Some time after that I adapted
Emily’s work for a game called <em>Mrs Pepper’s Nasty Secret</em> I wrote
jointly with Jim Aikin, hiving much of this work off into a separate
extension file. The present newbie.t module is based directly on this
work, and contains a number of VerbRules, action definitions and
StringPreParsers designed to trap such common badly-formed commands,
carry them out if there’s a reasonably plausible interpretation of what
the player probably meant, and explain what’s wrong with them and/or
point the player towards the correct form of the command. Hopefully,
this will seem much more user-friendly than a standard “command not
understood” message.</p>

<p>The reason that there’s a mixture of StringPreParsers and new
actions/VerbRules is that (in the main) the StringPreParsers are used to
field commands that are too badly formulated for a plausible
interpretation to be possible (so there’s nothing to execute), while the
additional commands/VerbRules generally attempt to interpret the command
and execute it before explaining the more conventional way of phrasing
the command. For example WHERE AM I is treated as a LOOK command, WHO AM
I as an X ME command, and KEEP GOING NORTH as a NORTH command, while
commands like I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO THROW THE KNIFE or YOU ARE A REALLY
STUPID GAME are fielded by a StringPreParser that recommends use of the
HELP command.</p>

<p>Both the VerbRules and the StringPreParsers defined in this module have
an isActive property defined as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isActive =
(gPlayerChar.currentInterlocutor == nil)</code>. The reason for this is
that commands that might be badly formed in the context of normal play
could conceivably be perfectly legitimate conversational responses, so
we don’t want any of these special actions or StringPreParsers to be
active while a conversation is in progress.</p>

<p><span id="bodyparts"></span></p>

<h2 id="body-parts">Body Parts</h2>

<p>Many if not most IF games don’t need the player to refer explicitly to
Body Parts with commands like WEAR SHOES ON FEET or OPEN DOOR WITH RIGHT
HAND. To field commands of this sort the newbie.t provides a
<strong>bodyParts</strong> object that matches the vocab of most common body parts
(e.g. ‘your feet’ or ‘my right hand’). This object is a
<a href="multiloc.html">MultiLoc</a> that’s defined to be everywhere by default, and
an <a href="extra.html#unthing">Unthing</a> so that if your game actually does
contain any body parts the parser will prefer them to the bodyParts
Unthing. If you find the bodyParts object a nuisance (perhaps because
your game actually uses a lot of body parts) you can banish it
altogether like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify bodyParts
      initialLocationClass = nil
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="playerhelper"></span></p>

<h2 id="the-playerhelper-object">The playerHelper object</h2>

<p>The three previous facilities for new players offered in newbie.t can
just be left to get on with their job, without much — possibly without
any — intervention from the game author. The fourth, the playerHelper
object, will almost certainly require some customization if it’s to work
to best advantage in your particular game. The basic function of the
playerHelper object is to track (a) whether the player is making any
progress and (b) whether the player is typing a lot of rejected commands
and offer help if insufficient progress is being made or too many
rejected commands are being entered.</p>

<p>We’ll start by listing its principal properties and methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ceaseCheckingErrorLevel</strong>: the proportion of rejected commands to
turns, expressed as a percentage, below which we stop checking for
errors. The default is 5 (in other words if less than 5 per cent of
the player’s commands are being rejected, the player presumably knows
what s/he’s doing, so we don’t need to keep checking).</li>
  <li><strong>errorCheckInterval</strong>: the number of turns between each check on
whether the player is entering too many erroneous commands. The
default value is 20.</li>
  <li><strong>errorThreshold</strong>: the proportion of rejected commands to turns (i.e.
accepted commands) that will trigger an offer of help. We express this
number as a percentage, the default being 50.</li>
  <li><strong>firstCheckAfter</strong>: this is the number of turns that must elapse from
the start of the game before the playerHelper first tries to offer any
help if the player appears not to be making any progress. The default
is 10.</li>
  <li><strong>firstCheckCriterion()</strong>: the condition that must be true to count as
the player having made no progress after the first <em>firstCheckAfter</em>
turns. If this condition is still true (or this method returns true)
at that point we display the <em>firstCheckMsg</em>. By default we simply
return nil (so that the condition is never met), since we don’t know
what’s appropriate for particular games, but many games will want to
override this to something more suitable.</li>
  <li><strong>firstCheckMsg</strong>: the message to display if no progress has been made
after <em>firstCheckAfter</em> turns. The default is a message inviting the
player to use the HELP command.</li>
  <li><strong>offerHelp</strong>: this method is designed to be called at the end of
gameMain.showAbout: it asks “Have you played this kind of game
before?” and calls helpMessage.printMsg() is the player replies NO,
thus ensuring that new players (or at least, honest new players) are
informed up front about the help available to them.</li>
  <li><strong>startLocation</strong>: the location in which the player character starts
out. It can be used to check whether the player character has moved at
all.</li>
</ul>

<p>The playerHelper has a number of other properties and methods that are
primarily intended for the library’s internal use, and which are
accordingly less likely to be worth customizing. Interested readers can
look these up in the <a href="../libref/index.html">Library Reference Manual</a>.
For now let’s concentrate on the firstCheck mechanism, which is what
game code will most often need to customize via the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstCheckCriterion</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstCheckAfter</code> properties. Basically what
happens is that at the start of play the playerHelper object sets up a
Fuse to execute the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstCheck()</code> method after
<em>firstCheckAfter</em> turns. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstCheck</code> method
then looks to see if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstCheckCriterion</code>
is true. If it is, then it displays a message saying that the player
doesn’t seem to be making much progress and suggesting use of the HELP
command (firstCheckMsg). It also sets a Fuse to start the error Daemon
after a decent interval. Otherwise, if the player does seem to have made
reasonable progress (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstCheckCriterion</code>
returns nil), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstCheck</code> starts the error
checking Daemon straight away.</p>

<p>What game code is most likely to need to customize here are the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstCheckCriterion</code> (the condition that must
be true if the player seems not to be making much progress) and,
perhaps, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firstCheckAfter</code> interval (the
number of turns into the game at which it’s reasonable to make the
check). Both these values may need a bit of trial and error to get right
(perhaps with the help of feedback from beta-testers), but we can at
least illustrate the principle here.</p>

<p>In a game in which exploration plays an important role, or where the
starting location is of little intrinsic interest other than as a
threshold to somewhere else, the simplest check might be whether the
player character is still in his/her starting location, for which we can
just write this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify playerHelper
        firstCheckCriterion() { return gLocation == startLocation; }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would, however, be quite inappropriate in a one-room game or a game
where there’s a lot to interact with in the starting location. In such a
situation a better alternative might be to test whether the player has
started interacting constructively with his/her environment. Suppose,
for example, that the player starts out carrying a document and that
there’s a chest (an openable container) in the starting location. One
might expect the player to begin by examining himself, the document and
the chest and then opening the chest to see what’s inside. We might then
decide that the player isn’t making satisfactory progress at the start
of the game if s/he hasn’t managed at least two out of those four
obvious actions after ten turns. We might then write the
firstCheckCriterion thus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify playerHelper
        firstCheckCriterion() 
        { 
            local checkList = [gPlayerChar.examined, document.examined,
                chest.examined, chest.opened ];
                
            return checkList.countWhich({x: x == true}) &lt; 2; 
        }    
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One other thing we can do if the player appears to be getting stuck is
to start the <a href="hint.html#extra">ExtraHints</a> mechanism, if we are using it
in our game, by calling extraHintManager.startDaemon(). We could, for
example, override firstCheckMsg to do this rather than displaying a
message telling players that they’re not making much progress:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify playerHelper
        firstCheckMsg() 
        { 
            extraHintManager.activate();
        }    
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some game authors may prefer this as a less intrusive (or less
belittling) approach.</p>

<p>Further help for new players can be provided by using the <a href="../../extensions/docs/cmdhelp.html">Command
Help</a> extension, which offers a
number of suggestions for a player to try if he or she enters an empty
command.</p>
