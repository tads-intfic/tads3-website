<h1 id="sysrules">Sysrules</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>“System Rules” module. This implements a number of rules and rulebooks
to allow game authors to tailor various aspects of the library’s
behaviour. The Rules extension is also needed to make use of Sysrules.</p>

<p><span id="classes"></span></p>

<h2 id="new-rulebooks-and-classes">New RuleBooks and classes</h2>

<p>This extension defines the following RuleBooks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em><a href="#startup">Start-up rulebooks</a></em>: <a href="#preinit">preinitRules</a>,
<a href="#init">initRules</a>.</li>
  <li><em><a href="#action">Action rulebooks</a></em>: <a href="#before">beforeRules</a>,
<a href="#report">reportRules</a>, <a href="#after">afterRules</a>.</li>
  <li><em><a href="#sequence">Turn Sequence rulebooks</a></em>: <a href="#start">turnStartRules</a>,
<a href="#end">turnEndRules</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these RuleBooks has a similarly-named rule class associated with
it; for example the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BeforeRule</code> class is used
to define rules belonging to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforeRules</code>
Rulebook. When using these specialized subclasses of Rule, there’s no
need also to specify which RuleBook they belong to, since this is taken
care of in the class definitions (e.g. if you define something as an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InitRule</code> it’s redundant to go on to define its
location property as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initRules</code>).</p>

<p><span id="usage"></span></p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Include the rules.t and sysrules.t files after the library files but
before your game source files (the rules extension is required for this
one to work). If you are not already familiar with the workings of the
rules extension you should first read its <a href="rules.html">documentation</a>
before attempting to use this one.</p>

<p>None of the rulebooks defined in this extension expects any parameters
to be passed to its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method. This
means that when you define rules belonging to any of these rulebooks,
you do not need to worry about defining any arguments for their
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> methods. With the exception of the
reportRules, all the RuleBooks defined in this extension have a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contValue</code> of nil; this means that the default
behaviour is for these RuleBooks to execute all the matching Rules they
find, rather than stopping at the first one.</p>

<p>By default this extension does not alter the way the adv3lite library
behaves (from a player’s perspective), but by effectively replacing one
or two methods and functions with rulebooks it makes the library’s
behaviour more customizable (by game authors) as well as providing a
number of hooks for additional author-defined rules. This is best
explained by discussing each of the rulebooks in turn.</p>

<p><span id="startup"></span></p>

<h2 id="startup-rules">Startup Rules</h2>

<p><span id="preinit"></span></p>

<h3 id="preinitrules">PreinitRules</h3>

<p>The <strong>preinitRules</strong> RuleBook starts out empty, but may be used to
define rules that run at the pre-init stage (basically as an alternative
to definining PreInit objects). Such rules may be defined by explicitly
locating them in the preinitRules Rulebook using either form of syntax:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     preinitRule1: Rule
        location = preinitRules
        follow()
        {
           me.name = 'Joe Bloggs';
        }
    ;

    preinitRule2: Rule @preinitRules
       follow()
       {
          ...
       }
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or alternatively, they may simply be defined as belonging to the
<strong>PreinitRule</strong> class:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     preinitRule1: PreinitRule    
        follow()
        {
           me.name = 'Joe Bloggs';
        }
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="init"></span></p>

<h3 id="initrules">InitRules</h3>

<p>The <strong>initRules</strong> rulebook likewise starts out empty, and can be used to
define rules that run at start of play (at the init stage). These can
again be defined as Rules which you explicitly locate in the initRules
rulebook, but it is probably more convenient to define them as rules of
the <strong>InitRule</strong> class (which are automatically located in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initRules</code> rulebook). InitRules are used in
very much the same way as PreinitRules, and effectively provide an
alternative to defining InitObjects. They are thus quite closely
equivalent to “when play begins” rules in Inform 7.</p>

<p><span id="action"></span></p>

<h2 id="action-related-rules">Action-Related Rules</h2>

<p>The function of the action-related rulebooks in this extension is <em>not</em>
not replace the TADS 3 style action handling with a set of Inform 7 like
rulebooks, but rather to provide some convenient rule-oriented hooks for
certain aspects of the action-processing cycle, in particular the before
and after notifications. Authors familiar with Inform 7 should therefore
not expect the three rulebooks described below to work in the same way
as the similarly-named rules in I7 (although the ReportRules are fairly
analogous).</p>

<p>Rules intended for one of these three rulebooks should be defined using
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BeforeRule</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReportRule</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AfterRule</code> class as appropriate. Each of these
has a <strong>currentAction</strong> property which identifies the particular action
that triggered the associated rulebook.</p>

<p>Rules that need to match particular actions can be defined using the
Rule template, e.g.:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     BeforeRule &amp;Jump
        // A BeforeRule that matches the Jump action
     ;
     
     AfterRule [Throw, ThrowDir]
        // An AfterRule that matches either the Throw or the ThrowDir action.
     ;
     
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the verify(), check() or action() stages of an action would benefit
from rule-like behaviour, you can define a custom RuleBook to handle
this and call it from within the appropriate verify(), check() or
action() method, as in the <a href="rules.html#jump">Jump</a> and
<a href="rules.html#digwith">DigWith</a> examples given in the documentation for the
Rules extension.</p>

<p>The description of the individual rulebooks below will list the rules
they contain along with their priorities. The ordering of rules within
rulebooks can then be changed (if desired) by overriding these
priorities, and additional rules inserted where required. Remember that
a rule with a higher priority is executed before one with a lower one.
Note that as far as possible the priorities of the library-defined rules
have been assigned so that additional rules with the default priority of
100 should normally come at a sensible place in the rulebook, although
you are, of course, free to assign whatever priority you wish to your
own rules to make them execute when you want them to.</p>

<p><span id="before"></span></p>

<h3 id="before-rules">Before Rules</h3>

<p>The main purpose of the <strong>beforeRules</strong> rulebook is to handle before
action notifications. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforeRules</code> rulebook
is defined in this extension with the following rules, which are
executed in the order shown:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>checkActionPreconditionsRule</strong>: (priority 10000). Checks the
preconditions relating to the action (as opposed to those defined on
its objects).</li>
  <li><strong>actorActionRule</strong>: (priority 9000). Calls the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actorAction()</code> method on
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gActor</code> (the current actor).</li>
  <li><strong>sceneNotifyBeforeRule</strong>: (priority 8000). Calls the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforeAction()</code> method on any current
scenes.</li>
  <li><strong>roomNotifyBeforeRule</strong>: (priority 7000). Calls the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomBeforeAction()</code> method on the actor’s
current room (which in turn calls the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regionBeforeAction()</code> method on any regions
that room is in).</li>
  <li><strong>scopeListNotifyBeforeRule</strong>: (priority 6000). Calls the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforeAction()</code> methods of all the objects
in scope.</li>
</ol>

<p>To define additional rules for this rulebook, use the <strong>BeforeRule</strong>
class. This inherits from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReplaceRedirector</code> as
well as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rule</code> and so provides the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doInstead()</code> method, should you need to use it.
Probably the best use for BeforeRules, however, is as an alternative
method of handling before notifications that don’t fit neatly into
existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforeAction()</code> methods, either
because they apply to multiple objects, or because they apply
conditionally, and it’s neater to handle the conditions in a series of
rules than via a complex if statement. For example, you might write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    BeforeRule &amp;Take  
       during = desperateHurryScene  
       dobj = [comb, penny, paperclip]
       
       follow()
       {
           "You don't have time to gather up petty items
           right now. ";
           exit;
       }   
       
       priority = 8500
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note three things here: first the use of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> macro to stop the action, and second the
priority given to this rule so that it comes after the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actorActionRule</code> but before the notification
rules; there’s no point notifying scenes, rooms and other objects of an
action that isn’t going to take place. Third and finally, there’s no
need to use the @ part of the template here to specify that your
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BeforeRule</code> is located in the beforeRules
RuleBook; in common with all the specialized Rule classes defined in
this extension, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BeforeRule</code> is automatically
located in the appropriate RuleBook.</p>

<p>Note finally that whether the beforeRules are executed before or after
the check phase will depend on the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gameMain.beforeRunsBeforeCheck.</code></p>

<p><span id="report"></span></p>

<h3 id="report-rules">Report Rules</h3>

<p>The ReportRules perform the same function as the
<a href="../../docs/manual/actres.html#report">report</a> phase of a TAction or
TIAction, namely to summarize the action across all the direct objects
it applied to in the course of executing a single command (e.g. “You
take the bath bun, the red brick, and the jar of olive oil.”). By
default, the <strong>reportRules</strong> rulebook contains two rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>reportImplicitActionsRule</strong>: (priority 10000). Displays any
pending implicit action reports (the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method of this rule ends with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nostop</code> to ensure that the subsequent rules
are considered).</li>
  <li><strong>standardReportRule</strong>: (priority 0). Displays the output of the
appropriate report() method from the final direct object in the
batch (i.e. carries out the normal library behaviour you’d get if
this extension wasn’t present).</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that unlike all the other RuleBooks defined in this extension, the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reportRules</code> are defined with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contVal = null</code> rather than
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contVal = nil</code>, which means that the rulebook
will stop after the first matching rule it finds. This enables you to
write custom a custom <strong>ReportRule</strong> without needing to remember to use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stop</code> to ensure that the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reportRules</code> rulebook doesn’t go on to display
the standard report as well as your custom one. You’d typically write a
ReportRule to customize the way an action is reported under specific
circumstances, for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ReportRule &amp;Take
       during = desperateHurryScene

       follow()
       {
          "{I} hastily snatch{es/ed} &lt;&lt;gActionListStr&gt;&gt;. ";
       }   
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note the use of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gActionListStr</code> macro here
to provide a list of all the direct objects to which the current Take
command applied; your report rules should always include this macro
where you want to mention the direct object of the command to ensure
that all the relevant direct objects are listed.</p>

<p>Finally, note that the reportRules will only run if no text was
displayed at the action() stage of the action in question for the
objects concerned.</p>

<p><span id="after"></span></p>

<h3 id="after-rules">After Rules</h3>

<p>The <strong>afterRules</strong> RuleBook is used principally to perform the various
<span id="afterac_idx">after action notifications</span>. If you are
familiar with Inform 7, you should note that this quite different from
an I7 after rule (which takes place between the carry out rules and the
report rules). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterRules</code> in this
extension are executed after the action is fully complete, and hence
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">after</code> the <a href="#report">reportRules</a>. They cannot
be used to change the outcome of the action in any way, but only how the
action is responded to. Moreover, if an action is considered a failure,
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterRules</code> won’t be run (since you can’t
react to an action that didn’t take place).</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterRules</code> Rulebook starts out containing
the following rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>checkIlluminationRule</strong> (priority 10000): checks whether the
action has changed the actor’s location from lit to unlit or <em>vice
versa</em> and, if so, either announces the onset of darkness (if it is
now dark) or displays a room description (if it is now light).</li>
  <li><strong>notifyScenesAfterRule</strong> (priority 9000): calls the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method on any current
scenes.</li>
  <li><strong>roomNotifyAfterRule</strong> (priority 8000): calls the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomAfterAction()</code> method on the actor’s
current room, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regionAfterAction()</code>
methods of any Regions that contain that room.</li>
  <li><strong>scopeListNotifyAfterRule</strong> (priority 7000): calls the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforeAction()</code> method on every object in
scope.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are basically two ways in which game code can make use of this
rulebook. The first is to reorder the existing rules by reassigning
their priorities, so that after action notifications take place in a
different order. The second is to define additional <strong>AfterRule</strong> rules
which implement additional responses to an action that has just taken
place.</p>

<p><span id="sequence"></span></p>

<h2 id="turn-sequence-rules">Turn Sequence Rules</h2>

<p>The two turn sequence rulebooks contain rules governing what takes place
at the beginning and end of each turn. In addition, they provide
convenient places to define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TurnStartRules</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TurnEndRules</code> to be executed on every turn,
either near the start or near the end of the turn, depending on which of
the two rulebooks you use. In some respects this duplicates the function
of a <a href="../../docs/manual/event.html#daemon-idx">Daemon</a>, but at the same
time it gives you more control over precisely where in the turn cycle
and under what conditions your code is run.</p>

<p><span id="start"></span></p>

<h3 id="turnstart-rules">TurnStart Rules</h3>

<p>The turnStartRules rulebook starts out containing the following rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>updateStatusLineRule</strong> (priority 10000): updates the status line.</li>
  <li><strong>scoreNotificationRule</strong> (priority 9000): displays any applicable
score notification.</li>
  <li><strong>promptDaemonRule</strong> (priority 8000): runs any
<a href="../../docs/manual/event.html#promptdaemon">PromptDaemons</a> that are
due to fire.</li>
  <li><strong>commandSpacingRule</strong> (priority 20): displays a blank line,
preparatory to displaying the next command prompt.</li>
  <li><strong>startInputLineRule</strong> (priority 10): outputs an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;.inputline\&gt;</code> tag preparatory to
displaying the next command prompt.</li>
  <li><strong>displayCommandPromptRule</strong> (priority 0): displays the command
prompt (by default “&gt;”).</li>
</ol>

<p>This rulebook does not go on to encompass the actual inputting and
parsing of the command (a) because these operations are protected by a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try... catch</code> block that cannot readily be
replicated within the same rulebook and (b) because it is in any case
probably not a good idea for game code to modify that particular part of
the cycle.</p>

<p>To define additional rules to be run in the turnStartRules rulebook, use
the <strong>TurnStartRule</strong> class. For example, to customize the command
prompt during the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desparateHurryScene</code> you
might write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     TurnStartRule
        during =  desperateHurryScene  
        follow()
        {
            "Hurry! ";
        }
        priority = 5
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that with this definition the rulebook will continue to execute the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">displayCommandPromptRule</code> after our custom
rule, so the complete command prompt will appear as <strong>Hurry! &gt;</strong>. If we
wanted to <em>replace</em> the standard command prompt entirely we’d need to
add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stop</code> statement to the end of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method of our custom rule.</p>

<p><span id="end"></span></p>

<h3 id="turnend-rules">TurnEnd Rules</h3>

<p>The <strong>turnEndRules</strong> rulebook deals with end-of-turn processing such as
running daemons and fuses and advancing the turn count. It starts out
containing the following rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>turnEndSpacerRule</strong> (priority 10000): adds a blank line to the end
of the previous command output.</li>
  <li><strong>roomDaemonRule</strong> (priority 9000): executes the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomDaemon()</code> method on the player
character’s current room.</li>
  <li><strong>executeEventsRule</strong> (priority 8000): executes any pending Fuses or
Daemons.</li>
  <li><strong>advanceTurnCounterRule</strong> (priority 50): advances the turn counter.</li>
</ol>

<p>To define additional rules to go into the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">turnEndRules</code> rulebook, use the <strong>TurnEndRule</strong>
class.</p>

<p><span id="performance"></span></p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-performance">A Note on Performance</h2>

<p>Employing the sysrules extension in principle gives the library quite a
lot of extra work to do, since it has to run through a number of
rulebooks where it would otherwise have simply executed successive
statements in a method or function. This is unlikely to result in any
noticeable degradation of performance from the perspective of a player,
at least any player using a reasonably modern computer, but could
conceivably make test scripts run a little slower. It is completely
pointless to install this extension in your game unless you actually
intend making use of it by defining new rules or reordering existing
ones, since this would be to make the library do a whole lot of extra
work for nothing. It may also be overkill to use this extension to
achieve something that could be achieved more simply (or just as simply)
by some other means (such as defining an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InitObject</code> or using a
<a href="../../docs/manual/message.html#custmessage_idx">CustomMessages</a> object
to change the prompt). On the other hand there is no reason why you
should not use this extension if you think it may prove useful or if you
want to experiment with it; in practice any slowdown in performance is
likely to be imperceptible (especially to players).</p>

<p>This covers most of what you need to know to use this extension. For
additional information see the source code and comments in the
