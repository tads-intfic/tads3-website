<h1 id="objective-time">Objective Time</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>“Objective Time” module. This implements a form of in-game time-keeping
that advances the clock by so much per turn. By default each turn is
reckoned to take one minute, but this can be changed in as fine-grained
a manner as game authors wish, for example to make some actions take
longer than others.</p>

<p><span id="classes"></span></p>

<h2 id="new-classes-objects-and-properties">New Classes, Objects and Properties</h2>

<p>In addition to a number of properties intended purely for internal use,
this extension defines the following new classes, functions, objects and
properties for use by game authors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Classes</em>: <strong>TimeFuse</strong>, <strong>SenseTimeFuse</strong>.</li>
  <li><em>Objects</em>: <strong>timeManager</strong>.</li>
  <li><em>Properties/methods on timeManager</em>:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">currentTime</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">formatDate(fmt)</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTime(\[args\])</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addInterval(interval)</code>.</li>
  <li><em>Properties/methods added to Action</em>:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advanceOnFailure</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeTaken</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">implicitTimeTaken</code>.</li>
  <li><em>Properties added to GameMainDef</em>:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gameStartTime</code>.</li>
  <li><em>Properties/methods added to TravelConnector</em>:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traversalTime</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traversalTimeFrom(origin)</code>.</li>
  <li><em>Functions</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addTime(secs)</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">takeTime(secs)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span id="usage"></span></p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Include the objtime.t file after the library files but before your game
source files.</p>

<p>When defining your <strong>gameMain</strong> object, you now need to define its
<strong>gameStartTime</strong> property to set the date and time of day at which your
game notionally starts. This should be set to a list of numbers in the
format <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[year, month, day, hour, minute, second,
millisecond\]</code>. Trailing zero elements may be omitted. For example
setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gameStartTime</code> to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[2014, 7, 23, 15, 30\]</code> would setting the
starting time of your game clock to 3.30pm on 23rd July 2014.
Alternatively the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gameStartTime</code> may be
specified as a Date object (for details of which consult the TADS 3
System Manual), for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    gameMain: GameMainDef
        initialPlayerChar = me   
       
        gameStartTime = static new Date(2014, 6, 22, 15, 30, 0, 0)
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is all you actually <em>need</em> to do to use the extension, but it won’t
be very useful if it’s simply updating the time each turn unless you do
something with the information. We shall now go on to discuss the things
you can do with it.</p>

<p><span id="displaying"></span></p>

<h3 id="displaying-the-time">Displaying the Time</h3>

<p>One of the most basic and obvious things you can do with the time is to
display it somewhere. To do this you can use the <strong>formatDate(fmt)</strong>
method of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dateManager</code> to return a string
containing the date, time, or date and time in a suitable format defined
by the <em>fmt</em> parameter. For example, to display the date and time at the
right-hand end of the status line you could do this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     modify statusLine
        showStatusRight()
        {
            "&lt;&lt;timeManager.formatDate('%c')&gt;&gt;";
        }
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For a full list of possible format strings, consult the chapter on the
Date intrinsic class in the TADS 3 System Manual. A few of the more
convenient ones are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%r</code> the full 12-hour clock time, e.g.
‘3:30:00 PM’</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%R</code> the 24-hour clock time with minutes, e.g.
‘15:30’</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%T</code> the 24-hour clock time with seconds, e.g.
‘15:30:00’</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%X</code> the preferred time representation
according to the locale settings; e.g. ‘15:30:00’</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%c</code> the preferred date and time stamp for the
locale, e.g.’Sun Jun 22 15:30:00 2014’</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%D</code> the short date (in American format), e.g.
to ‘06/22/14’</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%d/%m/%y</code> the short date (in European
format), e.g. ‘22/06/14’</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%d-%b-%y</code> the short date in dd-mmm-yy format,
e,g, ‘22-Jun-14’ (probably the best format to use to avoid USA/Europe
ambiguity)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%Y</code> the four-digit year number, e.g. 2014;
use in place of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%y</code> in any of the above when
a four-digit year is required.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%I:%M %P</code> the 12-hour clock time with
minutes, e.g. ‘03:30 PM’</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%a </code> the abbreviated weekday name (‘Mon’)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%A</code> the full weekday name (‘Monday’)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that these can be combined as needed, for example
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager.formatDate('%A, %d-%b-%y %I:%M
%P')</code> might return the string ‘Sunday, 22-Jun-14 03:30 PM’. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">formatDate()</code> method may, of course, be used
wherever you like in your game code, not just in the status line.</p>

<p><span id="scheduling"></span></p>

<h3 id="scheduling-events--timefuse-and-sensetimefuse">Scheduling Events — TimeFuse and SenseTimeFuse</h3>

<p>We can use the standard <a href="../../docs/manual/event.html">Fuse</a> class to
make something happen so many turns in the future. But what if we want
something to occur not after so many turns, but after a certain amount
of time (or indeed, at a certain time)? Since the objtime extension
allows us to keep track of time, we may sometimes find this a more
useful way to specify when something should happen than in terms of so
many turns. To that end the objtime extension defines a <strong>TimeFuse</strong>
class that works just like a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fuse</code>, but is
specified in terms of time rather than turns.</p>

<p>To create set up a TimeFuse, just create a new TimeFuse object thus:</p>

<p><span class="synLit">new
TimeFuse(</span><span class="synPar">obj</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">prop</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">timespec</span></p>

<p><span class="synLit">)</span></p>

<p>This defines a TimeFuse that will call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.(prop)</code>, i.e. the prop method of obj, after
an timespec of <em>timespec</em> turns or at the time specified by <em>timespec</em>.
How <em>timespec</em> is interpreted depends on how it is specified. It can be
any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A list in the format <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[years, months, days, hours,
minutes, seconds\]</code> (trailing elements can be omitted if they
are zero). The TimeFuse will then execute <em>after</em> the timespec
specified by the list.</li>
  <li>An integer, in which case the TimeFuse will execute after that number
of minutes.</li>
  <li>A BigNumber (which can be specified by simply including a decimal
point), in which case the TimeFuse will execute after than number of
hours. For example, an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timespec</code> of 1.25 will
cause the TimeFuse to execute 1 hour and 15 minutes after the TimeFuse
is created. Note than an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timespec</code> of 1.0
thus means one hour an while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timespec</code> of 1
means one minute.</li>
  <li>A Date (i.e. an object of the Date class), in which case the TimeFuse
will execute at the Date specified.</li>
  <li>A single-quoted string, in which case the TimeFuse will execute at the
time specified by the string. This can be either in the format ‘hh:mm’
(e.g. ‘15:34’) or ‘hh:mm:ss’ (e.g. ‘15:34:30’) to specify a time in
the current day, or the format ‘yyyy:mm:dd hh:mm:ss’ (e.g. ‘2014:06:22
15:34:00’, meaning 15:34 on 22nd June 2014), or in any of the other
formats accepted by the parseDate method of the Date class (for which
see the SystemManual); in practice the examples just given here are
probably the easiest to work with and should cover anything you’re
likely to need.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, therefore, that to specify how far into the future (the amount of
time <em>after which</em>) a TimeFuse should execute, the <em>timespec</em> parameter
needs to be a number or a list of numbers, while to specify the
date/time <em>at which</em> a TimeFuse should execute, the <em>timespec</em> parameter
needs to be a Date object or a string.</p>

<p>The SenseTimeFuse works just like a SenseFuse, except that the timespec
parameter works in the same way as for a TimeFuse, i.e.:</p>

<p><span class="synLit">new
<span id="sensefuse-idx">SenseTimeFuse</span>(</span><span class="synPar">obj</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">prop</span><span class="synLit">,
</span><span class="synPar">timespec</span><span class="synMark">[,
senseProp, senseObj]</span></p>

<p><span class="synLit">)</span></p>

<p>Where <em>senseProp</em> must be one of &amp;canSee, &amp;canHear or &amp;canSmell (or
conceivably &amp;canReach) and <em>senseObj</em> is the object that must be sensed
appropriately. Note that you can just supply the <em>senseProp</em> parameter
if you want to test whether <em>obj</em> can be heard or smelled, but that if
you supply the <em>senseObj</em> parameter you have to supply the <em>senseProp</em>
parameter as well.</p>

<p>Finally, note that since Fuses (including TimeFuses and SenseTimeFuses)
are only checked for execution once per turn, a turn may conceivably
carry the game time beyond the time at which a TimeFuse (or
SenseTimeFuse) was set to execute. If that happens, it will still be
executed at the end of the turn. In other words, towards the end of turn
cycle, every TimeFuse (and SenseTimeFuse) that has either reached or
passed the time at which it is due to execute will be executed.</p>

<p><span id="varying"></span></p>

<h3 id="varying-the-rate-at-which-time-passes">Varying the Rate at which Time Passes</h3>

<p>Used straight out of the box, the objtime extension simply advances the
game time by one minute every turn. This may not be want you want, in
which case there are several ways you can customize it to your
requirements.</p>

<h4 id="failed-actions">Failed Actions</h4>

<p>Probably the simplest of these is to prevent failed actions (e.g. those
that are stopped at the verify stage) from taking any time at all, since
in this case nothing has actually been accomplished and the player has
simply been informed why the proposed action can’t be carried out. To do
this we simply need to set the Action property <strong>advanceOnFailure</strong> to
nil, e.g.:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify Action
        advanceOnFailure = nil
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="action-times">Action Times</h4>

<p>The next simplest adjustment is to change the time taken by various
actions, by overriding their <strong>timeTaken</strong> property (which is specified
in seconds). You could do this globally for all actions, if you wished;
for example to make every action in the game take 20 seconds:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify Action
        timeTaken = 20
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or you may want different actions to take different amounts of time. For
example, to make examining something take 15 seconds and taking
something take 30 seconds you could do this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify Examine
        timeTaken = 15
    ;
     
    modify Take
        timeTaken = 30
    ;    
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And so on for as many action times as you care to customize.</p>

<p><span id="adjusting"></span></p>

<h4 id="adjusting-time-taken-on-particular-turns">Adjusting Time Taken on Particular Turns</h4>

<p>For even finer-grained control you can tweak the time taken for
particular actions with particular objects under particular
circumstances by using the <strong>addTime(secs)</strong> and <strong>takeTime(secs)</strong>
functions. The addTime(secs) function adds <em>secs</em> seconds to the time
taken for the turn. It can also reduce the time taken for the turn if
<em>secs</em> is negative, but it can never reduce it below zero. You can use
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addTime(secs) </code>function as many times as
you like in the course of a turn, and its effect will be cumulative.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">takeTime(secs)</code> function, on the other
hand, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">replaces</code> whatever the time taken for
turn would have been with <em>secs</em>. If
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">takeTime()</code> is used more than once in a turn,
it will be the latest one that takes effect, and if
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">takeTime()</code> is used on a turn, both the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeTaken</code> property for the action and any
calls to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addTime()</code> on the same turn will
simply be ignored.</p>

<p>As an alternative to calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addTime(n)</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">takeTime(n) </code>from within an embedded expression
you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;add n secs\&gt;\&gt;</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;take n secs\&gt;\&gt; </code>respectively, together
with some obvious variants.</p>

<p>In particular all these do the same thing:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     "&lt;&lt;takeTime(n)&gt;&gt;";
     "&lt;&lt;take n seconds&gt;&gt;";
     "&lt;&lt;take n secs&gt;&gt;";
     "&lt;&lt;take n second&gt;&gt;";
     "&lt;&lt;take n sec&gt;&gt;"; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And all these do the same thing as one another:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     "&lt;&lt;addTime(n)&gt;&gt;";
     "&lt;&lt;add n seconds&gt;&gt;";
     "&lt;&lt;add n secs&gt;&gt;";
     "&lt;&lt;add n second&gt;&gt;";
     "&lt;&lt;add n sec&gt;&gt;"; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, for example, if unlocking a door involves shifting a particularly
rusty bolt you could write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     + oldDoor: Door 'old oak door'
       ...
       lockability = lockableWithoutKey
       isLocked = true
       
       dobjFor(Unlock)
       {
          inherited();
          "The bolt is covered with rust and feels incredibly stiff, but after 
          wrestling with it a while you finally manage to unlock the door.
          &lt;&lt;take 150 seconds&gt;&gt; ";
       }
     
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="implicit"></span></p>

<h4 id="implicit-action-times">Implicit Action Times</h4>

<p>Another facet of time-keeping you may want to control is whether
implicit actions should count towards the time taken for the turn in
which they occur. By default they don’t since the default behaviour is
simply to take one minute per turn, but you may think it perverse that
the commands TAKE BALL, PUT BALL IN BOX should take two minutes in total
if both are given explicitly, but only one minute in total if TAKE BOX
is performed as implicit action in response to PUT BALL IN BOX. To
change this behaviour you can override the <strong>implicitTimeTaken</strong>
property of an Action to be the number of seconds that Action should
take when performed implicitly. To have every Action take the same time
when performed implicitly as it does when carried out in response to an
explicit command you can simply write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify Action    
        implicitTimeTaken = timeTaken
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can override the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">implicitTimeTaken</code> property to any number of
seconds you please, either globally or on individual actions.</p>

<p><span id="travel"></span></p>

<h4 id="travel-times">Travel Times</h4>

<p>As things stand, every travel action will take one minute, whether it’s
going from the kitchen to the hall or crossing a large field to enter a
wood on the far side. Moreover, if fastGoTo is enabled (either globally
or in a particular region) then a GO TO command could whip the player
character across the field, through the wood, up a path and over a
bridge all in one go, and the turn would still only take a minute.</p>

<p>If you want to change this, the best way is probably to turn off the
time taken by travel actions and instead make traversing
TravelConnectors take time instead, which you can do by setting their
<strong>traversalTime</strong> property. As a start you might do something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify TravelAction
        timeTaken = 0    
    ;

    modify TravelConnector
        traversalTime = 120
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This assumes that you reckon that in your game world, travel from one
place to the next should typically take two minutes. If your map was on
a smaller scale, you’d obviously choose a smaller number, perhaps only
30 seconds. Of course, it may be that not all distances on your game map
are equal. You can deal with this by assigning different
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traversalTime</code> values to different
TravelConnectors. Note that unless we’ve explicitly changed them in our
own code, we don’t need to override the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeTaken</code> properties of the GoTo and Continue
actions (as we otherwise might), since by default these take their
values from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TravelAction.timeTaken</code>.</p>

<p>That’s all very well up to a point, but what if many (if not most) of
your connections are direct from one room to another, without any other
TravelConnector object intervening? Since Room inherits from
TravelConnector, you can give a Room a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traversalTime</code>, but then that will be the time
taken to enter the room from any other room (unless the travel is
carried out via some intermediate TravelConnector such as a Door,
Stairway or Passage, in which case that intermediary TravelConnector’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traversalTime</code> will apply instead). You
probably won’t want to create a lot of extra TravelConnector objects
just to vary the TravelTime, however, so fortunately there’s another way
to handle this situation. Instead of overriding the room’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traversalTime</code> property, you can override its
<strong>traversalTimeFrom(origin)</strong> method (where <em>origin</em> is the other room
the traveler is coming from) to return different traversal times
depending on the origin. For example, suppose you think it should take
30 seconds to reach the meadow from the road, a minute to reach the
meadow from the river bank, and two minutes to reach it from the wood,
you could define the meadow’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traversalTimeFrom()</code> method accordingly:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     meadow: Room 'Meadow'
        "The road lies just to the south..."
        south = road
        north = wood
        east = riverbank
        
        traversalTimeFrom(origin)
        {
            switch(origin)
            {
               case road:
                  return 30;
               case riverbank:
                  return 60;
               case wood:
                  return 120;
               default:
                  return traversalTime;
            }
        }
    ;    
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default in the switch statement may not be strictly necessary, but
it may be as well to put in for safety; if you were later to add another
connection to the meadow and forget to change the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traversalTimeFrom()</code> method, it would at least
then handle it reasonably gracefully. Perhaps a more serious problem is
that this method of specifying travel times between different rooms
could quickly become quite tedious and long-winded if there were a lot
to specify. One way to alleviate this would be to use some kind of data
structure, perhaps a LookupTable, to store the different traversal times
between pairs of rooms and then define the traversalTimeFrom() method to
make use of it, e.g.:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     modify Room
        traversalTab = static [
            [road, meadow] -&gt; 30,
            [riverbank, meadow] -&gt; 60,
            [wood, meadow] -&gt; 120,
            ...
        ]
        
        traversalTimeFrom(origin)
        {
            local tim = traversalTab[[origin, self]];
            return tim == nil ? traversalTime : tim;
        }
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One alternative would be to use a list defined on each room of the
travel times from other rooms, something like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     modify Room
        timeFrom = []
        
        traversalTimeFrom(origin)
        {
            local idx = timeFrom.indexOf(origin);
            return idx == nil ? traversalTime : timeFrom[idx + 1];
        }
    ;

     meadow: Room 'Meadow'
        "The road lies just to the south..."
        south = road
        north = wood
        east = riverbank
        
        timeFrom = [road, 30, riverbank, 60, wood, 120]    
    ;    
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This may well be easier to work with, since the relevant data is kept
with the room it relates to. Either way you would, of course, only have
to specify the exceptions, since for any route not otherwise specified
the room’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traversalTime</code> would be used.</p>

<p><span id="leaps"></span></p>

<h4 id="time-leaps">Time Leaps</h4>

<p>The final kind of time adjustment you may want to deal with is leaps in
time. These may occur in your game if it contains a flashback, for
example, or if you cut from one scene to another that takes place hours
or even days later. In principle this is simple enough to do: you just
call the <strong>setTime()</strong> method of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager</code> object, or else update
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager.currentTime</code> directly. If you use
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTime()</code> method the arguments to pass to
it are the same as those you’d pass to the Date constructor (for which
see the TADS 3 System Manual). The two simplest formats to use are
probably:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager.setTime(year, month, day, hour,
minutes, seconds, ms)</code>: possibly the best bet if you want to
change both the date and the time; <em>year</em> is the year number (e.g.,
2012), <em>month</em> is the month (1 to 12), <em>day</em> is the day of the month
(1 to 31), <em>hour</em> is the clock hour (0 for midnight to 23 for 11 PM),
<em>minutes</em> is the number of minutes past the hour (0 to 59), <em>seconds</em>
is the number of seconds past the minute (0 to 59), and <em>ms</em> is the
number of milliseconds past the second (0 to 999).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager.setTime('hour:minutes:seconds')</code>
or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager.setTime('hour:minutes')</code>,
where <em>hour</em>, <em>minutes</em> and <em>seconds</em> have the same meaning as before.
This is probably the best option to use if you simply want to jump to
a different time on the same day. (Note that if you were using the
Date constructor directly you would need to supply a couple of extra
arguments to make sure the day did stay the same, but the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTime()</code> method takes care of this for
you.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to jump <em>by</em> a certain amount you can use the
<strong>addInterval(interval)</strong> method of timeManager, where <em>interval</em> can be
one of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A list of numbers in the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[years, months,
days, hours, minutes, seconds\]</code>; trailing zero elements may be
omitted.</li>
  <li>A single integer, in which case this will be taken as the number of
minutes to advance the time.</li>
  <li>A single BigNumber (a number containing a decimal point), in which
case this will be taken as the number of hours to advance the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager.addInterval(15)</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager.addInterval(0.25)</code> would both
advance the time by a quarter of an hour. Note that these numbers can be
negative as well as positive, so that, for example,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager.addInterval(-24.0)</code> would send the
time a day into the past. A further subtlety to note is that unless you
do something to prevent it, calling
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager.addInterval()</code> won’t prevent the
normal advance of time that takes place in any case on each turn. So,
for example, if each turn would normally take one minute and you call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeManager.addInterval(1)</code> you’ll find that
the game time has advanced by <em>two</em> minutes at the end of the turn, one
minute from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addInterval()</code> and the other from
the normal turn handling.</p>

<h2 id="final-considerations">Final Considerations</h2>

<h3 id="is-it-worth-it">Is it worth it?</h3>

<p>The Objective Time extension is capable of providing you with extensive
control over the passage of time in your game, but to do so in any great
detail will probably involve you in a large amount of work. Do you
really need it? After all, most Interactive Fiction gets by perfectly
well without giving players any explicit notification of the passage of
time, and if all you need is a few vague indications of time, to mark
the occurrence of major plot events, say, you’re probably better off
using the Subjective Time extension (<a href="subtime.html">subtime</a>), which will
cause you a lot less work. So why might you need to use objtime at all?</p>

<p>The kind of circumstance in which objtime might be useful are when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You want to display the game time in the status line (subtime is quite
unsuitable for this).</li>
  <li>Your game contains a number of puzzles for which timing is crucial and
needs to be measured with a plausible degree of accuracy.</li>
  <li>For dramatic reasons you want to create a sense of urgency by making
the player aware of the passage of time.</li>
</ul>

<p><span id="objandsub"></span></p>

<h3 id="objective-time-and-subjective-time">Objective Time and Subjective Time</h3>

<p>The objective time module is used, as we have seen, to keep track of
time based on the player’s actions, either at a constant rate per turn,
or at a number of seconds per turn determined by the game author as
described above. The <a href="subtime.html">subjective time</a> module, on the other
hand can be used to assign times to particular events in the game (e.g.
once the player enters the throne room, it’s three o’clock in the
afternoon; when he first meets the princess it’s half past four) and
then attempts to extrapolate between them if the player occasionally
consults the time (by looking at a clock in the hallway, for example).
The subjective time module also ensures that the time of the next event
is not reached prematurely. If the player character leaves the throne
room and wanders around for a while, the time will never reach half past
four until he meets the princess; if necessary the subjective time
module will slow down the passage of time to ensure that four thirty is
not reached prematurely (for a fuller explanation, see the explanation
of the <a href="subtime.html#rationale">Rationale</a> of the Subjective Time
module). This should work reasonably well so long as the player doesn’t
try to check the time too often, since it relies on the player not being
fully aware of how much time ought to have passed.</p>

<p>Most games should not include both the subtime and objtime modules,
since they use different (and basically incompatible) methods of
reckoning the time. It is, however, possible to include both modules in
the sense that your game will still compile, and it will even attempt to
synchronize the two incompatible clocks, so far as that can be done.
This will produce some odd results, however, such as the time
occasionally (or even quite frequently) jumping backwards from what the
objective time module thinks it should be, and there can seldom be many
occasions when it’s actually a good idea to include both modules. The
only good reason for doing do is if your game wants to use one method
for reckoning time in one segment of the game, and the other method in
another.</p>

<p>If both modules are present, the Subjective Time module attempts to
synchronize the two versions of time in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When a ClockEvent occurs, the Subjective Time module sets the
Objective Time module’s time to the same time.</li>
  <li>When the Subjective Time module commits to a time between two
ClockEvents, the the Subjective Time module sets the Objective Time
module’s time to the same time.</li>
  <li>When the Subjective Time module needs to calculate a time between two
ClockEvents (since it’s being asked to check the time), it will use
the Objective Time’s reckoning of time if and only if that would
result in an earlier time than it would otherwise have used (since one
of the main functions of the Subjective Time module is to prevent the
time of the next ClockEvent being reached too quickly).</li>
  <li>Once the last ClockEvent has been passed, the Subjective Time module
simply takes its time from the Objective Time module (rather than its
own reckoning of so many minutes per hundred turns).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note, however, that these attempts to synchronize two basically
incompatible methods of reckoning time can only be partially successful
at best, and may well produce odd results. In particular, it would be a
bad idea to display the objective time anywhere (at least until the last
ClockEvent had been past), since it is likely to jump backwards and
forwards in strange ways as it is synchronized with the subjective time.</p>

<p>In sum, then, <em>don’t include both the Objective Time module and the
Subjective Time module in the same game</em> unless you have a <em>very</em> good
reason for doing so and you’re quite sure you know what you’re doing.</p>

<p>This covers most of what you need to know to use this extension. For
