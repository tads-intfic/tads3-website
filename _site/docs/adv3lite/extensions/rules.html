<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of the <a href="../rules.t">rules.t</a> extension is to allow game code
to define Rules and RuleBooks. Rules are associated with RuleBooks,
which may be invoked at any point in game code to carry out actions
and/or return values to their caller.</p>

<p>In brief, calling the <strong>follow()</strong> method of a RuleBook causes it to
call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method of each of its
associated Rules in descending order of precedence (ignoring those Rules
that don’t match their conditions) until either one of these Rules stops
the sequence or there are no more Rules to call. The value returned to
the RuleBook by the last-executed Rule’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method is then returned to the caller
of the RuleBook’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method.</p>

<p>Doers and TopicEntries (especially Doers) are standard classes in the
main adv3Lite library that act a little like Rules, but the Rules
extension allows you to generalize this kind of functionality into all
sorts of other situations. It is most likely to be most useful in
situations where a tangle of nested if statements and switch statements
would otherwise be needed to code complex interactions, but you are, of
course, free to use rules wherever you wish.</p>

<p>This extension does not define any actual Rules or Rulebooks, but simply
the Rule and RuleBook classes that allow rules and rulebooks to be
defined. For some predefined rules and rulebooks that work with this
extension and provide rule-based access to certain aspects of the
action-processing and turn cycles, see the related
<a href="sysrules.html">sysrules</a> extension.</p>

purely for internal use, this extension defines the following new

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Include the rules.t file after the library files but before your game
source files.</p>

<h3 id="defining-rules-and-rulebooks">Defining Rules and Rulebooks</h3>

<p>At its simplest a RuleBook can be defined simply by giving it a name and
making it of the RuleBook class:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     jumpRules: RuleBook
     ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unless you need to refer to them in some other part of your code, rules
can usually be defined as anonymous objects located in the RuleBook to
which they belong by using the + property. The one method you must
define on a Rule is its <strong>follow()</strong> method; for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     + Rule
        where = room
        
        follow()
        {
            "You jump pointlessly. ";        
        }
    ;

    + Rule 
        where = nextRoom
        
        follow()
        {
            "You jump fruitfully. ";        
        }    
    ;

    + Rule
        follow()
        {
            "You jump energetically. ";       
        }  
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case we could have defined these rules even more succinctly as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     + Rule
        where = room
        
        follow = "You jump pointlessly. "
    ;

    + Rule 
        where = nextRoom
        
        follow = "You jump fruitfully. "        
    ;

    + Rule
        follow =  "You jump energetically. "          
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can do that here because in this RuleBook, the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> methods take no arguments. You can,
however, define as many arguments to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method of a RuleBook as you like;
precisely the same arguments will then be passed to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> methods of any Rule it invokes, so
you must make sure that the argument lists match, or you’ll get a
run-time error. If in doubt you can use the variable argument list
notation to ensure that your Rules match any argument lists that are
passed to them, for instance:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     + Rule
        where = room
        
        follow([args])
        {
            "You jump pointlessly. ";        
        }
    ;

    + Rule 
        where = nextRoom
        
        follow([args])
        {
            "You jump fruitfully. ";        
        }    
    ;

    + Rule
        follow([args])
        {
            "You jump energetically. ";       
        }  
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The advlite.h header file defines one template for use with Rules, which
can be used to define their location and/or action properties. If both
are present in the template the location property must be defined first,
preceded by @. The action property is defined either with &amp; or as a
list, e.g.:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    Rule @jumprules
       // A Rule located in the jumprules rulebook
       ...
    ;
     
    Rule &amp;Jump 
       // A Rule matching the Jump action.
       ...
    ; 

    dropRule: Rule @treetopRules [Drop, Throw, ThrowDir]
       /*  
        *  A Rule located in the treetopRules rulebook and matching
        *  any one of the Drop, Throw or ThrowDir actions.
        */
       ...
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="match_conditions"></span></p>

<h3 id="specifying-match-conditions-on-rules">Specifying Match Conditions on Rules</h3>

<p>Rules are only useful for distinguishing what should happen under
different circumstances. Most of the rules you define (with the possible
exception of the odd catch-all rule) will need to specify the conditions
under which they apply. This can be specified using one or more of the
following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>where</strong>: This can be the location either of the player character
(the default) or of the current actor, depending on the value of the
parent rulebook’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actor</code> property (indeed it
could be the location of whatever object is specified in the
rulebook’s actor property, but the intention is that this should
normally be either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gPlayerChar</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gActor</code>). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where</code>
property can be defined as a Room, a Region or a list of Rooms and/or
Regions.</li>
  <li><strong>when</strong>: This can be any condition that must be true for the Rule to
be matched. This is for use when none of the other means of
speficifying rule conditions will do the job.</li>
  <li><strong>who</strong>: The current actor (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gActor</code>): this
can be specified as a single actor or as a list of actors.</li>
  <li><strong>during:</strong> A Scene or a list of Scenes, one of which must be
currently happening for this Rule to be matched.</li>
  <li><strong>action</strong>: An action of list of actions, of one which must be the
current action (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gAction</code>) for the Rule to be
matched.</li>
  <li><strong>dobj</strong>: The direct object of the current action. This may be
specified as an object, a class, or a list of objects and/or classes.</li>
  <li><strong>iobj</strong>: The indirect object of the current action. This may be
specified as an object, a class, or a list of objects and/or classes.</li>
  <li><strong>aobj</strong>: The accessory object of the current action. This may be
specified as an object, a class, or a list of objects and/or classes.
Note that this property is only applicable when the
<a href="tiaaction.html">TIAAction</a> extension is included in your game.</li>
  <li><strong>matchObj</strong>: an object or class or list of objects and/or classes one
of which much match the first argument passed to the rulebook’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method. For example if the rulebook
is invoked with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow(helmetOfDoom)</code> the
Rule would be matched if its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matchObj</code>
property was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helmetOfDoom</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thing</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[helmetOfDoom,
pinkRabbit, cuddlyBear\]</code> (or anything else that included the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helmetOfDoom</code>). Note that while this
condition is principally intended to be used with objects, it will in
fact work with any kind of value, such as numbers and strings.</li>
  <li><strong>present</strong>: An object or a list of objects, one of which must be
present to the actor. See below on what ‘<a href="#present">present</a>’ means.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that where any of the foregoing properties is specified as a list,
the Rule will match if any of the items in the list matches (provided,
of course, that any other conditions are also met).</p>

<p>For example, to write a Rule that matches when either Fred or Mary drops
the crown jewels in either the hall or the lounge during the party scene
when the queen can see them you might write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + Rule
        follow()
        {
           "Oh dear! That was jolly embarrassing! Her Majesty does not look at all amused.&lt;.p&gt;";    
        }
        
        where = [hall, lounge]
        during = party
        who = [fred, mary]
        action = Drop
        dobj = crownJewels
        when = (queen.canSee(gActor))
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Assuming, that is, that we know that the player character will always
be present in the same location, otherwise further conditions would need
to be added).</p>

<p><span id="present"></span></p>

<h4 id="being-present">Being Present</h4>

<p>One of the properties we can define on a Rule is <strong>present</strong>, but what
does this mean?</p>

<p>First, this property must specify objects rather than classes, except
for one special case. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">present</code> property may
be defined as a single class (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">present =
Actor</code>), in which case the rule will be matched provided at least
one object of that class is in the same room as the actor (either
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gPlayerChar</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gActor</code>, depending on how the parent rulebook
defines this property).</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">present</code> property defines an
object or a list of objects, at least one of these objects must be
present in the same room as the actor for the rule to match.</p>

<p>There may, however, be occasions when ‘being in the same room as’ isn’t
quite what you want for a test of presence. For example, should the rule
match if the gem of ultimate destiny is in the same room as the actor
but hidden away inside a secret drawer the player character has yet to
open? Conversely, if the Elephant of Desire is clearly visible in the
neighbouring field, should it count as being present or not? To deal
with instances such as these you can define the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">present</code> property so that at least one of the
object or objects it lists needs to be perceivable by <em>actor</em> via a
given sense, which you define as one of the property pointers
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;canSee</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;canHear</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;canSmell</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;canReach</code>, e.g.:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      present = [&amp;canSee, gem]
      present = {&amp;canSmell, burntToast]
      present = [&amp;canHear, elephant, trumpet, sergeantMajor] 
      
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="precedence"></span></p>

<h3 id="rules-order-of-precedence">Rules’ Order of Precedence</h3>

<p>We stated above that when RuleBooks are called, they run through their
matching Rules in descending order of precedence. But how is that order
of precedence determined?</p>

<p>Left to its own devices, the Rules extensions orders rules according to
their specificity (how specific their conditions are). The more
conditions are specified (out of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">when</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">who</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">during</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dobj</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iobj</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aobj</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matchObj</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">present</code>) the more specific the Rule is
considered to be. Also, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where</code> condition
referencing at least one Room is considered more specific that one that
one references Regions, and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dobj</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iobj</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aobj</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matchObj</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">present</code>
property that includes at least one object is considered more specific
that one that only refers to classes. Finally, if two rules appear to be
equally specific, precedence is given to the one defined later in your
source code (it may at first sight seem counter-intuitive to do it this
way round, but this is consistent with the way the library handles Doers
and AltTopics). Normally this default ordering will give you what you
want; a more specific rule will take precedence over a more general rule
without your having to worry about it. Note, however, that the library
has no way of judging how specific a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">when</code>
condition is, which is why it’s normally better to use the other
condition properties when you can.</p>

<p>If for any reason you need to change the order of precedence there are a
couple of ways you can do so. The first is to specify that the current
rule must run either after or before one or more other specified rules
(which would then need to be named so they can be referred to), by
listing those other rules in the <strong>execAfter</strong> or <strong>execBefore</strong>
properties respectively. For example, to ensure that your
dangerousJumpRule executes after your dodgyJumpRule but before your
fatalJumpRule you might write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + dangerousJumpRule: Rule
         action = 'Jump'
         follow = "I wouldn't jump here if I were you. "
         execAfter = [dodgyJumpRule]
         execBefore = [fatalJumpRule]
    ;  
      
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will then override any other ordering the library would have made.
Note, however, it is then your responsibility to ensure that any use you
make of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execAfter</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execBefore</code> is consistent. If the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dodgyJumpRule</code> were specified in both the
execAfter and the execBefore properties of the same rule, for example,
this would be self-contradictory; in this case the library would resolve
the contradiction by ignoring the execBefore specification. On the other
were rule A to specify that it is to be run after rule B, while rule B
specified that it was to run after rule A, the outcome would be
unpredictable.</p>

<p>The second method of reordering rules is to override their <strong>priority</strong>
property. The default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">priority</code> is 100. The
higher the priority, the higher the precedence, so that a Rule with a
priority of 2000 will be run before a Rule with a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">priority</code> of 1. Changing the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">priority</code> to a very high or a very low value
can thus be a useful way of ensuring that a Rule runs towards the
beginning or the end of its RuleBook (or, provided you assign the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">priority</code> numbers with sufficient care) that it
is either the very first or the very last Rule to be considered. Note
that any rearrangement of rule ordering carried out via the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execBefore</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execAfter</code> properties will take precedence over
the setting of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">priority</code> property, however.
Apart from that, Rules with the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">priority</code>
will be ordered according to their specificity.</p>

<p>A RuleBook re-sorts the rules it is considering each time its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method is called, so that if you
change the value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">priority</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execBefore</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">execAfter</code> properties during the course of your
game, these changes will take effect the next time the corresponding
RuleBook is invoked. Normally, however, a rule’s specificity is only
calculated once, at preinit, so if you made any changes to a rule that
might change its specificity you would need explicitly to issue the
statement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x.specificity = x.calcSpecificity()</code>
(where <em>x</em> was the rule in question) for any reordering to take effect.
Such dynamic changes to rules’ precedence and conditions should only be
needed very rarely and should be used very sparingly, otherwise your
code is likely to become quite confusing.</p>

<p><span id="starting"></span></p>

<h3 id="starting-and-stopping-rulebooks-return-values-and-parameters">Starting and Stopping Rulebooks: Return Values and Parameters</h3>

<p>As we have seen, the way to start a RuleBook is to call its <strong>follow()</strong>
method. This causes it to select all of the rules that belong to it that
also match their various criteria, and then to run through them in
descending order of precedence, calling each of their
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> methods in turn until either there
are no more rules to consider or one of the rules signals that no more
rules should be considered after itself. But how does a rule signal
that?</p>

<p>The default behaviour is for a RuleBook to stop iterating through its
rules when one of its rules returns any value except <strong>null</strong>, where
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code> is an enum that has been defined for this
purpose. Since TADS 3 considers a method that does not have an explicit
return value to implicitly return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> (and
since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>
are different values) this means that the default behaviour of a
RuleBook is to execute the highest priority matching rule, and then stop
iterating through any other rules that happen to match. Since the
RuleBook returns whatever its last-executed rule returns, this means
that by default it will simply return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> to
its caller (assuming it actually executes any rules). Often this
behaviour may be just what you want, since if you simply want your
RuleBook to execute the most appropriate Rule, you may not be interested
in the return value, and you will probably want the RuleBook to stop at
the first rule it finds (in order of precedence).</p>

<p>There may be occasions when you want to change this behaviour, however.
First, it may that you want to define a Rule that doesn’t stop its
RuleBook. You can do that by ending the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method of that rule with the
<strong>nostop</strong> macro, for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + Rule
        priority = 1000
        follow()
        {
            "You tense yourself. ";
            nostop;
        }
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This rule will always run first (assuming there’s no rule in the same
RuleBook to which we’ve given a higher priority), but it won’t stop the
RuleBook. We could have used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return null</code>
rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nostop</code> here, but not only is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nostop</code> less typing (and perhaps clearer in
meaning), for reasons we’ll explain shortly it’s also safer.</p>

<p>If you’re defining a RuleBook in which you want the majority of Rules
not to stop the processing of further Rules in that RuleBook, you can
override the RuleBook’s <strong>contValue</strong> (short for ‘continuation value’)
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> instead of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contValue</code>
property defines the value a Rule must return if it is <strong>not</strong> to stop
the processing of the RuleBook. Since (as we mentioned just above) a
method with no explicit return value implicitly returns nil, this means
that the RuleBook won’t then stop at a rule with no explicit return
value (and hence an implicit return value of nil). If you want some
rules in such a RuleBook to stop the RuleBook from processing any more
rules, you can make those rules return a non-nil value or use the
<strong>stop</strong> macro to do this for you (by default
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stop</code> returns true, but you can change what it
returns by overriding the RuleBook’s <strong>stopVal</strong> property).</p>

<p>As has been mentioned before, if a Rule returns any value other than its
RuleBook’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contVal</code> value, the RuleBook will
pass that value back to its caller. This may be useful simply as a way
of telling the caller what the RuleBook did, but it could also be used
if you wanted a RuleBook to calculate a value. Suppose, for example, you
wanted to use a RuleBook to calculate the player character’s happiness
rating; you could do something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     happinessRules: RuleBook
        contVal = nil
        total = 0
        initBook()
        {
           total = 0;
        }
     ;
     
     + Rule
        priority = 0
        follow()
        {
           return rulebook.total;
        }
     ;
     
     + Rule
       when = (me.hasSeen(gertrude))
       follow()
       {
          rulebook.total += 3;
       }
     ;
     
     + Rule
       action = Kiss
       dobj = gertrude
       follow() { rulebook.total += 2; }
     ;

     + Rule
       action = Attack
       who = gertrude
       dobj = me
       follow() { rulebook.total -= 10; }
     ;

     + Rule
       when = (orbOfSatisfaction.isIn(me))
       follow() { rulebook.total += 6; }
     ;   
     ... 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how we here define a custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total</code>
property on the RuleBook to keep track of the value we want to
calculate. We can then use the <strong>initBook()</strong> method (which is called
whenever we call the RuleBook’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code>
method) to reset the value of total to 0 before our rules go on to
calculate its new value. We also supply a Rule with a priority of 0
(which should ensure that it’s the last rule to run) to return the value
of rulebook.total once all the other Rules have had their chance to
adjust it. Finally, note the use of the <strong>rulebook</strong> property of a Rule
to reference the Rulebook that triggered it (in this case, so that we
can get at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total</code> property of that
Rulebook).</p>

<p><span id="arguments"></span></p>

<h4 id="passing-arguments">Passing Arguments</h4>

<p>Although it’s often fine to call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code>
method of a RuleBook with no arguments, you can pass arguments if you
need to. These arguments are then passed in turn to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method of each Rule executed by the
RuleBook and by the RuleBook’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initBook()</code>
method, so you must make sure that their argument lists match those you
plan to pass to their RuleBook’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code>
method (or you’ll get a run-time error due to argument mismatch). Thus,
for example, if you are going to call a RuleBook’s follow() method with
two arguments (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myRules.follow(john, 'silly')</code>,
say) then you must ensure that you define all the associated Rules’
follow() methods and the RuleBook’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initBook()</code>
method with two arguments (assuming you override the latter at all; if
you don’t, you don’t need to worry about it). If in doubt you can use
the variable argument list syntax on these methods so they’ll match any
parameters that are passed to them, like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      myRules: RuleBook
        initBook([args])
        {
           foobar = 0;
           ...
        }
        ...
      ;

     + Rule
         follow([args])
         {
           ...
         }
         ...
     ; 
      
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That way, you can be sure of avoiding any problems. But, to repeat the
point, this is only necessary if you plan to pass any arguments to your
RuleBook’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow()</code> method, which very often
you won’t need to do.</p>

<p>You can use the arguments you pass (if you pass any) for any purpose you
find useful, but bear in mind that the first argument you pass will be
used to set the value of the RuleBook’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matchObj</code> property for its Rules’
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matchObj</code> properties to match against. This
first argument will then be passed as the first argument to each of the
matching Rules’ follow() method, which can be helpful as a way of
telling a Rule which specific object it’s matching. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>       myRules.follow(magicOrb); // called somewhere else in your code
     
       ...
       
       myRules: RuleBook;
       
       + Rule
          matchObj = Treasure
          follow(obj)
          {
              "\&lt;&lt;obj.theNameIs&gt;&gt; worth &lt;&lt;obj.points&gt;&gt;. ";
          }
       ;   
     
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assuming you have defined the magicOrb to be of the Treasure class (and
have given it a points property), this will allow your rule to refer to
the specific Treasure matched (in this case the magicOrb), although it
would, of course, have matched any other Treasure.</p>

<p><span id="manipulating"></span></p>

<h3 id="manipulating-rules">Manipulating Rules</h3>

<p>There are a couple of ways you can manipulate Rules at run-time. First
of all you can temporarily disable a Rule by calling its
<strong>deactivate()</strong> method, which sets its <strong>isActive</strong> property to nil.
You can set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isActive</code> back to true again by
calling the Rule’s <strong>activate()</strong> method. When a Rule is deactivated it
can never be matched, so this may occasionally be a useful way of
temporarily removing a Rule from consideration.</p>

<p>You can also move Rules between RuleBooks, or add Rules to more than one
RuleBook at a time, using the following methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>moveInto(rb)</strong>: move this Rule to the <em>rb</em> RuleBook, moving the Rule
out of every RuleBook it was in previously. If <em>rb</em> is nil this has
the effect of leaving the Rule detached from any RuleBook.</li>
  <li><strong>addTo(rb)</strong>: add this Rule to the <em>rb</em> RuleBook while also leaving
it in its current RuleBook(s). This allows a Rule to be used in more
than one RuleBook at a time.</li>
  <li><strong>removeFrom(rb)</strong>: remove this Rule from the <em>rb</em> RuleBook while
leaving it attached to any other RuleBook(s) it may be associated
with.</li>
</ul>

<p><span id="using"></span></p>

<h2 id="using-rules">Using Rules</h2>

<p>This extension defines the Rule and RuleBook classes, but it doesn’t
define any actual Rules or RuleBooks. It’s up to you as a game author to
decide where you want to use them in your game.</p>

<p>Rules and RuleBooks are typically likely to be useful where a relatively
complex set of responses would otherwise require a mass of if and switch
statements to code, although there may often ways of approaching the
same problem in adv3Lite. For example, if you want the Jump action to
work differently in different situations, you could write a whole lot of
roomBeforeAction() methods to intercept the Jump action, but it might be
neater to redefine the action itself so that it uses a RuleBook:</p>

<p><span id="jump"></span></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     modify Jump
        execAction(cmd)
        {
            jumpRules.follow();
        }
    ;

    jumpRules: RuleBook
    ;
     
    + Rule
       when = (goldBullion.isIn(me))
       follow()
       {
          "The bullion is so heavy your feet hardly leave the ground. ";
       }
     ;
     
     + Rule
       where = lowCave
       follow()
       {
          "Your head bumps the ceiling. Ouch! ";
       }
     ;
     
     + Rule
        present = [king, queen, auntAgatha]
        follow()
        {
           "You hesitate to leap around in the presence of so
            august a personage. ";
        }
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If there were many such factors involving the outcome of a JUMP command,
it could become quite convoluted to code them in any other way.</p>

<p>Rules are less likely to be useful for coding the responses to TActions,
since normally these can be quite easily dealt with in the various
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dobjFor()</code> sections of the direct object,
although again there may be occasional cases where the outcome of an
action depends on so many factors that defining a RuleBook and calling
it from the action() method may be the neatest way to deal with it. This
approach is more likely to be useful for TIActions, especially when
different outcomes depend on different combinations of direct object and
indirect object and perhaps other circumstances besides, which could
then be quite messy to code in the dobjFor() or iobjFor() sections of
the direct and/or indirect objects. For example, suppose that a variety
of objects can be used to dig a variety of other objects in a variety of
places under a variety of circumstances. The neatest way to handle it
might be something like this:</p>

<p><span id="digwith"></span></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     modify Thing
        dobjFor(DigWith) { action() { diggingRules.follow(); } }
     ;   
      
     diggingRules: RuleBook;
     
     + Rule
         where = sandyBeach
         follow()
         {
            "You dig in the sand with {the iobj}, but turn up nothing
              of interest. ";
         }
     ;

     + Rule
         dobj = rockyPath
         follow()
         {
            "You find you can make little impression on the hard,
             rocky path with {the iobj}. ";
         }     
     ;
     
     + Rule
        dobj = rockyPath
        iobj = pickaxe
        follow()
        {
           "You manage to break through the surface of the rocky
            path with the pickaxe. As a result you uncover a
            small gold box. ";
            goldBox.moveInto(me.location);
        }
     ;
      
     + Rule
        dobj = rockyPath
        iobj = pickaxe
        when = (goldBox.moved)
        follow()
        {
           "Digging around in the path with the pickaxe reveals
            nothing further of interest. ";
        }
     ; 
        
     + Rule
        dobj = rockyPath
        priority = 150
        present = [&amp;canSee, gardener]
        {
           "You start to wield {the iobj}, but when you see
            the gardener looking your way you decide you'd
            better stop. ";
        }
     ; 

     ... 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that in this second case, the check() and verify() methods of the
direct and indirect objects will already have ensured that the player
character is attempting to dig something that can sensibly be dug with
something that can sensibly be employed as a digging implement, so your
digging rules would not need to test for any of that. If the check
conditions were also likely to be complicated you could always define
separate checkDigging and actionDigging RuleBooks and call them from the
check() and action() methods respectively.</p>

<p><span id="doers"></span></p>

<h3 id="rules-and-doers">Rules and Doers</h3>

<p>Rules are a lot like Doers, and at first sight it might appear that both
examples above could equally well have been handled with Doers, for
example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     + Doer 'jump'
       when = (goldBullion.isIn(me))
       execAction(c)
       {
          "The bullion is so heavy your feet hardly leave the ground. ";
       }
     ;
     
     + Doer 'jump'
       where = lowCave
       execAction(c)
       {
          "Your head bumps the ceiling. Ouch! ";
       }
     ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would almost have the same effect, but not quite. By calling the
jumpRules from within the Jump Action you ensure that the Jump action
actually takes place. That means that any preconditions of jumping (such
as not being in any nested room) are honoured, and that the relevant
beforeAction() notifications are sent. This does not happen if you use
Doers to try to achieve the same thing. You may not notice the
difference, but again you may, since you might later go on to add a
roomBeforeAction() or a beforeAction() method that’s intended to trap a
Jump action, and then discover that it doesn’t work (because the
beforeAction() notification are never being sent). You could manually
call the beforeAction() notifications from your Doers (usually by
setting their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">handleAction</code> property to true),
but that’s extra work, potentially quite a lot of extra work if you’ve
defined quite a few of them. Using Doers works well if you want:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To stop an action happening at all (and presumably display a message
explaining why), e.g. “There’s not enough room here to jump. “; or</li>
  <li>To turn one action into another, e.g. to make PUT CARD IN SLOT
perform the action UNLOCK SECURITY DOOR WITH CARD.</li>
</ol>

<p>Otherwise, if you want the original action to go ahead, you may well be
better off using Rules. That way you can take full advantage of the
beforeAction() notifications, as well as of any verify() and check()
methods the library already defines for you. (Also, Rules take a more
fine-grained approach that Doers to sorting themselves in order of
specificity, which may also be helpful in complex cases).</p>

<p>This covers most of what you need to know to use this extension. For
