<h1 id="symconn-symmetrical-connectors">Symconn (Symmetrical Connectors)</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of the Symconn extension is to simplify setting up two-way
travel connectors, that is single objects that represent an abstract
travel connection, passage, door, or stairway between two locations
(rather than needing to do this with pairs of objects, as in the
standard library). This extension can also automate the creation of
reverse connections;if this extension is included then defining a direct
connection from one room to another will automatically lead to the
creation of a reverse connection from the second room to the first,
unless the game already defines a connection back or the reverse
direction property has already been defined on the second room.</p>

<p><span id="classes"></span></p>

<h2 id="new-classes-objects-and-properties">New Classes, Objects and Properties</h2>

<p>In addition to a number of properties intended purely for internal use,
this extension defines the following new classes, objects and
properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Classes</em>: <a href="#symcons">SymConnector</a>, <a href="#sympassage">SymPassage</a>,

</ul>

<p><span id="usage"></span></p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Include the symconn.t file after the library files but before your game
source files.</p>

<p>When the symconn extension is present, it will automatically set up
reverse connections between rooms where game code doesn’t already do so.
In the standard library, if you set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hall.east</code>
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study</code>, say, you would also have to set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study.west</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hall</code>
if you wanted the player character to be able to move back and forth
between the two rooms (as most of the time you probably would). The
symconn extension looks after this for you, so that if you set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hall.east</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study</code>,
this extension will then automatically set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study.west</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hall</code>,
<em>unless</em> you have already defined <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study.west</code>
to be something other than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or you’ve
defined some other way back from room2 to room1.</p>

<p><span id="noexit"></span></p>

<p>In cases where you don’t want a connection between rooms to be
symmetrical, you need to define the connection back from the second room
yourself (e.g. if you want the connection from the second room to the
first to be to the southeast when the connection from the first room to
the second is to the west). In such cases you could define the reverse
connection to be a different room (if you were trying to create a
confusing maze, for example). If you want there to be no way from the
second room to the first, you need to define something on the reverse
direction of the second room (for example, on the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">east</code> property of a second room that’s to the
west of the first). You could define this to be a single-quoted or
double-quoted string explaining why travel back that way isn’t possible,
or you could define it to be <strong>noExit</strong>, which then mimics there being
no connector back in that direction. So, for example, if it was possible
to go down from the cliff to the ravine, but not to go up from the
ravine to the cliff, you could define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cliff.down =
ravine</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ravine.up = noExit</code> (or else
perhaps a string explaining that the cliff was too steep to climb.)</p>

<p>If you want to stop the symconn extension setting up reverse connections
altogether (for example, because you want to use the classes symconn
defines without this automatic reverse connection behaviour) you can
override the <strong>autoBackConnections</strong> on the Room class to nil. Setting
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">autoBackConnections</code> on an individual room to
nil will prevent symconn from automatically creating any reverese
connections back to that room. (This is defined on the Room class, since
it’s the Room class that’s responsible for setting up these automatic
reverse connections).<br />
<span id="symcons"></span></p>

<h2 id="symmetrical-travel-connectors">Symmetrical Travel Connectors</h2>

<p>This extension also defines the <strong>SymConnector</strong> class and its three
subclasses, <a href="#sympassage">SymPassage</a>, <a href="#symdoor">SymDoor</a> and
<a href="#symstair">SymStairway</a>.</p>

<p>SymConnector is a type of
<a href="../../docs/manual/travel.html">TravelConnector</a> (from which it descends
by inheritance). A SymConnector can be traversed in both directions, and
defining a SymConnector on a direction property of one room
automatically attaches it to the reverse direction property of the room
to which it leads. Otherwise, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymConnector</code>
behaves much like any other TravelConnector, and can be used to define
travel barriers or the side-effects of travel in much the same way. For
example, we could define:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     defile: Room 'Narrow Defile'
            
        east: SymConnector -&gt; precipice
        "You just manage to squeeze through. "     
        {        
            
            canTravelerPass(traveler)
            {
                return traveler.getCarriedBulk &lt; 4;                
            }
            
            explainTravelBarrier(traveler)
            {
                "You can't squeeze through carrying so much stuff. ";
            }
        }
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would cause the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymConnector</code> (the
very same object, not just a copy of it) to be attached to the west
property of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">precipice</code> room, so that
travelling east from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defile</code> or west from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">precipice</code> would be subject to precisely the
same restriction on the maximum bulk carried by the traveler, and would
result in exactly the same “You just manage to squeeze” through message
being displayed if travel were allowed in either direction. Travelling
west from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">precipice</code> would then take the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traveler</code> back to the defile. (If you needed to
vary the details of what happened according to the direction of travel
you could always test the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traveler.getOutermostRoom</code> to determine which
end <em>traveler</em> was starting from).</p>

<p>Internally a SymConnector defines a <strong>room1</strong> property and a <strong>room2</strong>
property, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room1</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room2</code> being the two rooms reciprocally
connected by the SymConnector. At preinit the symconn extension
automatically sets the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room1</code> property of a
SymConnector to the room one of whose direction properties is attached
to that SymConnector, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room2</code> property
of the SymConnector to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">destination</code> of the
SymConnector. In the example about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-\&gt;
precipice</code> in the template defines the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">destination</code> property (directly) and hence the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room2</code> property (indirectly). So, to set up a
SymConnector you’d typically use the coding pattern illustrated above:
attach it to the direction property of one room and leave the extension
to set up the reverse connection from the other room.</p>

<p>However, you can also use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymConnector</code>
(including a <a href="#sympassage">SymPassage</a>, <a href="#symdoor">SymDoor</a> or
<a href="#symstair">SymStairway</a>., for which see below) to set up an
<em>asymmetric</em> connection, by defining a different direction from the
obvious reverse one on the second room to point back to the same
SymConnector. For example, if you have room1’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">west</code> property and room2’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">southeast</code> property point to the same
SymConnector, this extension won’t then attempt to make room2’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">east</code> property do so. If you don’t want there
to be any way back from room2 to room1 then there’s little point using a
SymConnector at all; you’d be better off using an ordinary
<a href="../../docs/manual/travel.html">TravelConnector</a> to set up the one-way
connection.</p>

<p><span id="sympassage"></span></p>

<p>A <strong>SymPassage</strong> is a kind of <a href="#symcons">SymConnector</a> representing a
physical object that’s present in both the locations it connects. A
SymPassage is also a <a href="../../docs/manual/multiloc.html">MultiLoc</a>, which
the symconn extension automatically places in its two locations at
preinit. It is very like a <a href="#symdoor">SymDoor</a>, except that it can’t be
opened or closed (at least, not via player commands). The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPassage</code> class can be used to define
passage-like objects such as passageways and archways that connect one
location to another. A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPassage</code> is otherwise
defined in exactly the same way as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymDoor</code>;
from a player’s perspective it is functionally equivalent to a
<a href="../../docs/manual/extra.html#travelconn">Passage</a>, the differences from
the game author’s point of view being that it can be defined using one
game object instead of two and that this extension automatically takes
care of setting up the connection in the reverse direction.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways a SymPassage object can be defined. The first
(which is particularly useful if you want the passage to be a nested
objectas in the cave example below) is to set the direction property of
the first room to point to it and then to set its own destination
property to point to the second room, like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    firstRoom: Room 'First Room'
        "A narrow passage leads east. " 
        east = myPassage
    ;

    myPassage: SymPassage 'narrow passage'
         destination = secondRoom   // or we could the template to just have -&gt; secondRoom
    ;

    secondRoom: Room 'Second Room'
       "A narrow passage leads west. "
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will work, since the extension will take care of locating the
passage in both the rooms and pointing the second room’s west property
back to the same passage. But, particularly if the three object
definitions are quite widely separated in game code, it may be less than
obvious later what the connections are. The recommended coding pattern,
therefore is to set the passage’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room1</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room2</code> properties explicitly (which can be done
via a template, as shown below) and to set the back connection on the
second room explicitly, like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    firstRoom: Room 'First Room'
        "A narrow passage leads east. " 
        east = myPassage
    ;

    myPassage: SymPassage 'narrow passage' @firstRoom @secondRoom
         
    ;

    secondRoom: Room 'Second Room'
       "A narrow passage leads west. "
       west = myPassage
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="roomdesc"></span></p>

<p>It’s possible that the passage looks the same from both ends, in which
case you can just set its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desc</code> property in the
normal way, but the two ends of passage may look different, in which
case you can define a separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room1Desc</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room2Desc</code> to define how it looks from each end
(which is another reason you might want to define the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room2</code>
properties explicitly, so you can see which is which).</p>

<p>The change in appearance might, however, lead to a change in the way the
passage should be referred to; for example the passage might be narrow
at one end but broaden out at the other. To handle this you can use the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room1Vocab</code> and/or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room2Vocab</code> properties explicitly. You don’t
need to define both, since if you define one, the extension will use the
passage’s initial <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab</code> property for the
other. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    firstRoom: Room 'First Room'
        "A narrow passage leads east. " 
        east = myPassage
    ;

    myPassage: SymPassage 'narrow passage; leading east' @firstRoom @secondRoom
        room1Desc = "The passage leading east is quite narrow, but looks like it broadens out further along. "
        room2Desc = "The passage leading west is quite broad, but looks like it narrows further along. "
        room2Vocab = 'wide passage; broad leading west'     
    ;

    secondRoom: Room 'Second Room'
        "A wide passage leads west. "
        west = myPassage
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Having to define two description properties where the descriptions don’t
vary all that much feel like a lot of busywork. An alternative is to
define simply the one desc property and vary it using embedded
expressions (the &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; syntax). SymConnector and its descendants
define a number of properties and methods to help with this. The
<strong>inRoom1</strong> and <strong>inRoom2</strong> properties are true if the player character
is in room1 or room2 respectively. The <strong>room1Dir</strong> and <strong>room1Dir</strong>
properties give the direction of travel (as a Direction object) the
player character must go in to traverse this room from room1 and room2
respectively, while the <strong>dirName</strong> property gives the name of that
direction from the perspective of the player character’s current
location (assuming this is either room1 or room2. This would enable us
to define the myPassage object aboce as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    myPassage: SymPassage 'narrow passage; leading east' @firstRoom @secondRoom
        "The passage leading &lt;&lt;dirName&gt;&gt; is quite &lt;&lt;inRoom1 ? 'narrow' : 'broad'&gt;&gt; but looks like it &lt;&lt;inRoom1 ? 'broadens out' : 'narrows'&gt;&gt; further along. "
        
        room2Vocab = 'wide passage; broad leading west'     
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be compressed a bit further by using the <strong>byRoom</strong> method for
the desc property thus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      "The passage leading &lt;&lt;dirName&gt;&gt; is quite &lt;&lt;byRoom(['narrow', broad'])&gt;&gt; but looks like it &lt;&lt;byRoom(['broadens out', 'narrows])'&gt;&gt; further along. "    
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the byRoom() method takes a single argument that should be a
list of two strings, the first to be displayed for room1 and the second
for room2. This allows all alternative method of achieving the same
result using a string template thus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     "The passage leading &lt;&lt;dirName&gt;&gt; is quite &lt;&lt;['narrow', broad']) by room&gt;&gt; but looks like it &lt;&lt;['broadens out', 'narrows'] by room&gt;&gt; further along. "   
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The use of these techniques is not restricted to the desc property; they
can be employed on any property/method of a SymmConnector (such as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">travelDesc</code>) you may want to vary according to
the room or direction of travel (travelDesc is invoked while the player
character is still in the starting location, so if the player is in
room1 travel is towards room2 and vice versa). Note that the byRoom()
method is also defined on Thing, where is simply returns an empty
string. Game code could thus use it elsewhere than with the symconn
extension for whatever purpose a game author deems convenient, passing a
list of whatever length is useful for the purpose.</p>

<p>Note, however, that all these techniques assume that the player
character is either in room1 or room2 when viewiing the SymConnector in
question. This may mot be the case if the SymCommector is visible from a
remote location that’s part of a
<a href="../../docs/manual/senseregion.html">SenseRegion</a> also containing the
player character. This shouldn’t matter too much provided suitable care
is taken in defining the SymConnector’s
<a href="../../docs/manual/senseregion.html#remoteprops">remoteDesc(pov)</a>
appropriately.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPassage</code> class also defines the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOpen</code> property which is true by default. The
symconn extension makes no use of this property on
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPassage</code>, but a game could use it to
simulate a passage that starts out blocked, e.g.:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     cave: Room 'Cave'
        "A passage runs off to the west. "
        west: SymPassage
        {
           -&gt; cave2
           'passage; narrow'
           "&lt;&lt;isOpen&gt;&gt;It's quite narrow, but you should be able to squeeze through. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It's blocked by a fall of rock. &lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;"
           
           isOpen = nil
           canTravelerPass(traveler) { return isOpen; }
           
           explainTravelBarrier(traveler)
           {
               "The passage is blocked by rubble from a rockfall. ";
           }
        } 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then at some later point in the game when the player managed to unblock
the passage you would call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cave.west.makeOpen(true);</code></p>

<p><span id="sympathpassage"></span></p>

<p>A <strong>SymPathPassage</strong> is a kind of <a href="#sympassage">SymPassage</a> representing
a path, road, or track (the kind of thing you might find in an outside
location as opposed to a passage indoors). It behaves exactly like a
SymPassage except that players can also GO ALONG, GO UP, GO DOWN, or
FOLLOW it, all of which have the same effect, namely of travelling via
the SymPathPassage.</p>

<p><span id="symdoor"></span></p>

<p>The <strong>SymDoor</strong> class lets you define a door using one object instead of
the usual two. Using the standard adv3Lite library you’d typically set
up a <a href="../../docs/manual/door.html">door</a> between two rooms like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     redRoom: Room 'Red Room'
       "A door leads south. "
       
       south = blackDoor1
     ;
     
     + blackDoor1: Door 'black door'
        "It's black. "
        otherSide = blackDoor2
     ;
     
     greenRoom: Room 'Green Room'
       "A door leads north. "
       north = blackDoor1  
       
    + blackDoor2: Door 'black door'
        "It's black. "
        otherSide = blackDoor1
    ;   
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using the SymDoor class this could be reduced to this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     redRoom: Room 'Red Room'
       "A door leads south. "
       
       south = blackDoor
     ;
     
     blackDoor: SymDoor 'black door' @redRoom @greenRoom
        "It's black. "
        
     ;
     
     greenRoom: Room 'Green Room'
       "A door leads north. "
       
       north = blackDoor
     ;    
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You don’t actually need to define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">north =
blackDoor</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">greenRoom</code> here, since the
symconn extension will do this for you, but, as mentioned above, you
might find it easier to understand what’s going on in your code if you
do.</p>

<p>Since SymDoor inherits from <a href="#sympassage">SymPassage</a>, you can set it up
in just the same way. In particular you can use the
<a href="#roomdesc">room1Desc</a>, room2Desc, room1Vocab and room2Vocab properties
just as you would on a SymPassage. In addition, on a SymDoor you can
define <strong>room1Lockability</strong> and <strong>room1Lockability</strong> properties to make
the <a href="../../docs/manual/thing.html#behaviour">lockability</a> work in
different ways on each side of the door (although if you want the same
lockability on both sides of the door you can just override its
lockability property). The one thing you can’t do is define different
keys to work on the different sides of the door. If you really wanted to
do that you’d be better off using the regular
<a href="../../docs/manual/door.html">Door</a> class to define the door as two
different objects.</p>

<p><span id="attachdir"></span></p>

<p>It’s sometimes convenient to refer to a door by the direction it leads
in (e.g. “The west door” or “The north door”). The symconn extension
takes care of this for you automatically. For example, the black door in
the example above can be referred to by the player as ‘south door’ when
the player character is in redRoom and as ‘north door’ when the player
character is greenRoom and the game will know which door is meant,
without the game author having to take any steps to make this happen.
If, however, you want to suppress this behaviour on a particular
SymDoor, you can do so simply by overriding its <strong>attachDir</strong> property
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attachDir</code> is
a method that works out which direction property a SymDoor is attached
to in the player character’s location, which is used by the <strong>DirState</strong>
<a href="../../docs/manual/thing.html#manipulatevocab">State</a> object to add the
appropriate direction name adjectives, such as ‘north’, to the SymDoor’s
vocab).</p>

<p><span id="symstair"></span></p>

<p>The <strong>SymStairway</strong> class lets you define a stairway using one object
instead of the usual two (a paired StairwayUp and StairwayDown). In
essence you can define a SymStairway in just the same way as a
<a href="#sympassage">SymPassage</a>, using the same properties to customize its
two ends if and as desired. In addition, however, a SymStairway needs to
know which is its upper end and which its lower end, which it does via
its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upperEnd</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lowerEnd</code> properties (which should contain the
rooms at its upper and lower ends respectively). Provided the
SymStairway is attached to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">up</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">down</code> property of at least one of the rooms it
connects, the extension can work out which end is which for itself and
there’s no need for you to specify this in your game code. The extension
can also do this if the connection to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">up</code>
or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">down</code> property is indirect, via an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asExit()</code> macro, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">up
asExit(west)</code> where the SymStairway is directly attached to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">west</code> property. If, however, the SymStairway is
only reachable via a compass direction (or in or out) then you’ll need
to define its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upperEnd</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lowerEnd</code> properties yourself.</p>

<p>On the subject of the asExit() macro, if you define
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">up asExit(west)</code> on the lower room, it’s
generally a good idea to define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">down
asExit(east)</code> (or whatever direction takes you back down) on the
upper room, since if the player reaches the upper room with the command
UP s/he’ll expect be to able to reverse that travel with the command
DOWN. For that reason, if this extension finds an UnlistedProxyConnector
(as Exit()) on the up or down property of a room, it will ensure that
there’s a matching UnlistedProxyConnector on the corresponding down or
up property of the destination room, unless that property has been
already overriden in game code or there’s no other way back down defined
on the destination room. Normally this will be what you will want, but
if you don’t (for example, because there are several ways down from the
destination room), you can block this by defining the down direction on
the upper room (say) as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">noExit</code> or else,
perhaps, as a string explaining why DOWN is not an appropriate
direction, for example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpwn = 'From here staircases
lead down to north, east and west; which way do you want to go?'</code>.</p>

<p>In addition to the shortcut methods for writing descriptions on other
kinds of SymCommector, SymStairway defines <strong>inUpper</strong> and <strong>inLower</strong>
properties which evaluate to true or nil depending on whether the player
character is at the upper end or lower end of the SymStairway in
question. The <strong>upOrDOwn</strong> evaluates to ‘down’ if we’re at the upper end
and ‘up’ if we’re at the lower end (these being the ways the stairway
will run from either end). Finally, the <strong>byEnd()</strong> method works
analogously to the byRoom() method, taking as its argument a list of two
strings, and returning the first if we’re at the upper end of the
stairway and the second otherwise. So for example one could define:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    testStairs: SymStairway 'staircase; ; stairs' @startroom @orangeRoom
        "The stairs &lt;&lt;['climb', 'descend'] by room&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;upOrDown&gt;&gt; to the &lt;&lt;dirName&gt;&gt;. "
        
        travelDesc = "{I} {run} &lt;&lt;upOrDown&gt;&gt; the stairs. "
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPassage</code> is a subclass of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymConnector</code> (and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MultiLoc</code>) and the superclass of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymDoor</code>, but that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymPassage</code> does not inherit from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Passage</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymDoor</code>
from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Door</code>, or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SymStairway</code> from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StairwayUp</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StairwayDown</code>.</p>

<h2 id="further-considerations">Further Considerations</h2>

<p>The symconn extension doesn’t enable you to do anything you couldn’t do
without it; it just makes setting up (most) connections a bit less work.
The main upside is that it gives you a bit less typing to do; a
corresponding potential downside is that it may make your code less
clear, since some of the connections between rooms will be implicitly
added by the extension rather than shown explicitly in your code (for
example, if you define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hall.east</code> as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study</code> and leave this extension to define
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study.west = hall</code>, then when you come to look
at your code later it may not be apparent that there’s an exit west from
the study to the hall (especially if the definitions of the study and
the hall are some way apart in your code). You could, of course, add a
comment to that effect, but then you might as well have defined
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study.west = hall</code> in your code. A subsidiary
advantage of using this extension is that should you forget to define a
connection back (e.g. you define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hall.east</code> as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study</code> but forget to define
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study.west</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hall</code>),
this extension will take care of it for you. The corresponding
disadvantage is that you’d have to remember to explicitly define
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">study.west = noExit</code> if for some reason you
didn’t want the connection back, although since this is unlikely to
occur very often, in this instance the advantage might clearly outweigh
the disadvantage.</p>

<p>So one way to use this extension might be to define all directional
connections you want on each room explicitly (so it’s clear in your code
where every direction leads) but to take advantage of the SymConn,
SymPasaage and SymDoor classes to avoid having to define pairs of
objects where a single object can do the job perfectly well, while
regarding the extension’s ability to supply any missing back connections
as an added bonus in cases of accidental omission.</p>

<p>Being able to define doors with one (SymDoor) object instead of two
(Door) objects may well be a welcome saving of labour, especially if the
majority of doors in your game are the same both sides, as may often be
the case. To make your code clearer, you may prefer to define the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room2</code>
properties on your SymDoors (and SymPassages) explicitly; for example,
instead of:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    blackDoor1: SymDoor 'black door'
        "It's black. "
        room2 = greenRoom
     ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You could write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    blackDoor1: SymDoor 'black door'
        "It's black. "
        room1 = redRoom
        room2 = greenRoom
     ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or, using an alternative form of the SymPassage/SymDoor template:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    blackDoor1: SymDoor 'black door' @redRoom @greenRoom
        "It's black. "    
     ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which may make it clearer in your code which two rooms the black door is
connecting. Note, however, that if you do this you must also define
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redRoom.south = blackDoor</code> (and you could also
optionally define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">greenRoom.north = blackDoor</code>
if you wished for the sake of clarity). Or, more generally, if you
explicitly define the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room1</code> property on a
SymDoor or a SymPassage, you must (normally) also remember to assign the
SymDoor or SymPassage to a direction property of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">room1</code>.</p>

<p>A possible exception to this, where you would have to define the room1
and room2 properties explicitly without assigning the SymDoor to a
direction property of room1 would be if you were trying to model the
presence of more than one door leading in the same direction. For
example, suppose there were two doors, a red door and a green door both
leading west from the same room. One way you could model this might be
as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     livingRoom: Room 'The Living Room' 
        "There are two doors on the west side of the room, one red and
         the other green. "
            
        west: TravelConnector
        {
            getDestination(origin)
            {
                switch(pcRouteFinder.currentDestination)
                {
                case redRoom:
                    return redRoom;
                case greenRoom:
                    return greenRoom;
                default:
                    return nil;
                }
            }
            
            execTravel(actor, traveler, conn)
            {
                local dest = getDestination(traveler.getOutermostRoom);
                if(dest == redRoom)
                    redDoor.execTravel(actor, traveler, conn);
                else if(dest == greenRoom)
                    greenDoor.execTravel(actor, traveler, conn);
                else            
                {
                    "There are two doors to the west, a red one and a green one. ";
                    askChooseObject(GoThrough, DirectObject, 'Which one do you want
                        to go through? ');
                }
            }
        }
        
        
    ;

    redDoor: SymDoor 'red door' @livingRoom @redRoom
    ;

    greenDoor: SymDoor 'green door' @livingRoom @greenRoom
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, most of the complication on the TravelConnector defined on
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">livingRoom.west</code> is simply to allow the
routefinder to find a route to the red room and the green room through
the red and green doors. If you weren’t concerned about that, you could
simply define:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>       west()
       {
           "There are two doors to the west, a red one and a green one. ";
            askChooseObject(GoThrough, DirectObject, 'Which one do you want
            to go through? ');
       }
     
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But then GO TO RED ROOM and GO TO GREEN ROOM might fail to work as
expected.</p>

<p>Overall it’s up to you as a game author to weigh up the pros and cons of
various different approaches, including whether or not to use this
extension, and then make your own decision about how you want to work.</p>

<p>This covers most of what you need to know to use this extension. For
