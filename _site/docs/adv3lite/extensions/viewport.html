<h1 id="viewport">Viewport</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of the <a href="../viewport.t">viewport.t</a> extension is to allow
game authors to define objects such as windows or CCTV screens that can
be used to view remote locations and their contents when they’re looked
through or examined, without having a listing of the remote locations in
question appearing in the room listing of the current room. This can be
useful for implementing objects such as windows and CCTV screens where
the player only becomes aware of what they show when s/he uses them.</p>

<p><span id="classes"></span></p>

<h2 id="new-classes-objects-and-properties">New Classes, Objects and Properties</h2>

<p>In addition to a number of properties intended purely for internal use,
this extension defines the following new classes, objects and
properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Classes</em>: <strong>Viewport</strong> and <strong>SwitchableViewport</strong>.</li>
  <li><em>Objects</em>: <strong>QViewport</strong>.</li>
  <li><em>Additional properties/methods on Room</em>:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomRemoteDesc(pov)</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomsViewed</code>.</li>
  <li><em>Properties/methods on Viewport</em>:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">describeVisibleRooms()</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visibleRooms</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lookThroughToView</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">examineToView</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isViewing</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span id="usage"></span></p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Include the viewport.t file after the library files but before your game
source files. Make sure that senseRegion.t is also included in the
build.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Viewport</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SwitchableViewport</code> are mix-in classes that can
be used to define objects such as windows and CCTV screens that can be
used to view remote locations. The only difference between them is that
a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SwitchableViewport</code> can be turned on and off,
so that the remote room and its contents can only be viewed while it’s
on.</p>

<p>Looking through or at a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Viewport</code>, or looking
at a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SwitchableViewport</code> displays a description
of the room it provides a view of, including any listable contents (for
which isVisibleFrom(pov) is true when <em>pov</em> is the actor doing the
looking). Once the player character has used the Viewport, the player
can refer to the contents of the remote room just viewed, until the
player character leaves the room (when the list of rooms viewed is
reset). This models the likelihood that the player character would only
become aware of the contents of the items in the remote location after
using the Viewport, but that having seen, say, a statue standing out in
the street when looking through the window, the player character might
reasonably try to examine the statue. On the other hand the contents of
the remote locations seen through Viewports are never listed in the
description of the current room, on the basis that they’re not objects
that the player character would actively notice when s/he’s not looking
through the Viewport.</p>

<p>To define what room or rooms a Viewport allows sight of, list them in
the Viewport’s <strong>visibleRooms</strong> property.</p>

<p>To describe what the remote room looks like through the Viewport, define
its <strong>roomRemoteDesc(pov)</strong> method (where <em>pov</em> will be the actor
viewing the room). By default this does nothing, so that if a Viewport
overlooks more than one room you can use the roomRemoteDesc(pov) method
of the first room to describe the entire view (should you so wish).</p>

<p>The <strong>describeVisibleRooms()</strong> method of a Viewport is the method that
actually describes the remote location(s) visible by virtue of the
Viewport. If <strong>lookThroughToView</strong> is true (as it is by default on
Viewport but not SwitchableViewport) then this method will be called
when LOOKING THROUGH the Viewport. If <strong>examineToView</strong> is true (as it
is by default on both Viewport and SwitchableViewport), then it is
called when EXAMINING the Viewport.</p>

<p>The <strong>isViewing</strong> property defines whether the Viewport currently
affords a view of the rooms in its visibleRooms list. On Viewport
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isViewing</code> is true by default, whereas on
SwitchableViewport <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isViewing</code> follows the value
of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsOn</code>.</p>

<p>The <strong>roomsViewed</strong> property of a Room keeps track of which rooms have
been viewed via Viewports from within the Room, so that their contents
can subsequently be referred to in commands. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomsViewed</code> property is reset to an empty list
when the player character leaves the room, on the basis that on
returning the pc would need to use the Viewport again in order to become
aware of what it shows. Switching off a SwitchableViewport also removes
its list of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visibleRooms</code> from its enclosing
room’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomsViewed</code> list, since they’re no
longer visible. If anything else affects what can be seen via a
Viewport, you may need to adjust the room’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomsViewed</code> list in your own code.</p>

<p>Note that you wouldn’t normally use a SenseRegion as well to provide a
sensory connection between the room a Viewport’s in and the room it
overlooks.</p>

<p>To define a window the player character can look through you can just do
this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     + window: Viewport, Fixture 'window'   
        isOpenable = true   
        visibleRooms = [alley]       
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you’d also want to define an appropriate roomRemoteDesc() on the
alley:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     alley: Room 'Alley'
        "A narrow east/west alley, ...&lt;.p&gt;"
          
        roomRemoteDesc(pov)
        {
            "Through the window {i} {can} see a narrow east/west alley.&lt;.p&gt;";
        }
    ;
     
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To define a CCTV monitor that provides a view into a cell, in outline we
could do something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     + tv: SwitchableViewport, Heavy 'cctv monitor'
        specialDesc = "A cctv monitor lurks in the corner. "
        visibleRooms = [cell]
    ;

    ...

    cell: Room 'Cell'
         "This small square cell is almost bare apart from a
          bunk along wall. "

        roomRemoteDesc(pov)
        {
            "The screen shows a small, square cell, with a
            bunk hard against the far wall.&lt;.p&gt;";
        }    
    ;

    + clothes: Wearable 'pile of clothes'
        "Quite a mixture. "
        sightSize = large
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="setrooms"></span></p>

<p>Occasionally, you may want to change the room or rooms a Viewport looks
into. For example, it may be possible to switch a CCTV monitor between
different cameras, or the view from a train window may change as the
train progresses down the track. You can do this by calling the
<strong>setRooms(lst)</strong> method of a Viewport, where <em>lst</em> is the list of rooms
(or just one individual room) that you want the Viewport to overlook
from now on. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setRooms()</code> rather than just
changing the Viewport’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visibleRooms</code> property
directly ensures that the appropriate adjustments are also made to the
enclosing rooms’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomViewed</code> property at the
same time.</p>

<p>This covers most of what you need to know to use this extension. For
additional information see the source code and comments in the
<a href="../viewport.t">viewport.t</a> file.</p>
