<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This extension defines the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Collective</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DispensingCollective</code> classes, which can help
with situations where you have one object representing a collective
(e.g. a bunch of grapes) and one or more objects representing items
drawn from that collective (e.g. individual grapes). The Collective
class helps overcome disambiguation issues when both the collective and
individual items are in scope (e.g. when ‘grapes’ might refer either to
the bunch of grapes or to one or more individual grapes) and the
DispensingCollective class further assists with making the collective
issue individual items on demand (e.g. TAKE GRAPE or TAKE GRAPE FROM
BUNCH) can be made to move an individual grape into the player
character’s inventory even when no individual grape is yet in scope).</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Include the collective.t file after the library files but before your
game source files. Define an object to be of either the Collective Class
or the DispensingCollective class as discussed further below.</p>

<p><span id="collective"></span></p>

<h2 id="collective-class">Collective Class</h2>

<p>The principal purpose of the <strong>Collective</strong> class is to resolve clashes
that might otherwise occur between a collective (such as bunch of
grapes) and individual items making up or taken from that collective.
For example, supposed we defined an object representing a bunch of
grapes together with a class to represent individual grapes thus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    bunch: Thing 'bunch of grapes[n]'
      ...
    ;  
     
    class Grape: Food 'grape; round green juicy loose'
      "It's round, green and juicy. "
      disambigName = 'loose grape'  
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we were then to define a number of grapes (objects of the Grape
class) and any of them were in scope at the same time as the bunch
object, the noun ‘grapes’ (by itself) would match either the bunch or
any of the individual grapes (since adv3Lite automatically recognizes
‘grapes’ as the plural of ‘grape’). This can lead to annoying
disambiguation messages or unintended consequences in response to
commands like TAKE GRAPES. Particularly when there is only one loose
grape in scope along with the bunch of grapes, the player is likely to
intend ‘grapes’ to refer to the bunch and ‘grape’ to the individual
grape. The use of the disambigName alleviates this problem a little, but
does not fully solve it. A better solution is to make the bunch a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Collective</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    bunch: Collective 'bunch of grapes[n]'
          isCollectiveFor(obj) { return obj.ofKind(Grape); }
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="iscollective"></span></p>

<p>The first thing to note here is the use of the <strong>isCollectiveFor()</strong>
method. In order to decide whether it or some other object should
respond to the player’s command, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Collective</code>
needs to know what objects it needs to be distinguished from, that is,
which objects it is acting as a collective for. In this case we want the
parser to make the correct selection between the bunch of grapes and
individual (loose) grapes; in other words the bunch is a collective for
individual grapes, which in this case will be objects of the Grape
class. We thus need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isCollectiveFor(obj)</code> to
return true if and only if <em>obj</em> is a Grape.</p>

<p>But there’s more going on behind the scenes that immediately meets the
eye here. How does the parser know when what the player types is meant
to refer to the bunch rather than to loose grapes? It’s clear enough if
the player types BUNCH, but not so clear if the player types GRAPES. The
answer is that the parser looks to see if what the player typed to
described the object in question has any words (or ‘tokens’) in common
with those defined on the Collective’s <strong>collectiveToks</strong> property. In
the example above, however, this property seems not to have been
defined. In fact, if it’s not defined by the user (game author), the
library defines it automatically from the Collective’s name property; so
in the example above the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collectiveToks</code>
property is automatically set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\['bunch', 'of',
'grapes'\]</code>.</p>

<p>Much of the time this will work perfectly well, but what if our
Collective can be described in more than one way? Suppose, for example,
we have a stack of cans object that can also be referred to as a pile of
tins. If we left the library to set the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collectiveToks</code> property the parser would still
take CANS to refer to the stack rather than to one or more individual
cans, but could not make the same distinction if the player typed TINS.
One way to deal with this would be to set the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collectiveToks</code> property manually:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     canStack: Collective 'stack of cans;;pile tins'
        isCollectiveFor(obj) { return obj.ofKind(Can); }
        collectiveToks = ['stack', 'of', 'cans', 'pile', 'tins'] 
     ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will work since the library will see that we’ve defined the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collectiveToks</code> property for ourselves, so it
won’t overwrite it with the tokens from the name property, but it’s a
bit more typing than we need to do, since we’ve had to repeat the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'stack', 'of', 'cans'</code> that the library would
otherwise have dealt with for us. A better alternative, then, is to use
the <strong>extraToks</strong> property. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraToks</code>
property is defined as a list of tokens, these will be added to the list
of tokens the library builds from the Collective’s name when it
initializes its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collectiveToks</code> property. The
above example could then be re-written:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     canStack: Collective 'stack of cans;;pile tins'
        isCollectiveFor(obj) { return obj.ofKind(Can); }
        extraToks = ['pile', 'tins'] 
     ;   
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, action-processing code (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dobjFor</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iobjFor</code> methods) defined on a Collective can
test the value of its <strong>collectiveDobjMatch</strong> and
<strong>collectiveIobjMatch</strong> properties to see whether the Collective was
matched as either the direct or indirect object of the command using any
of the tokens in its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collectiveToks</code> property.
This is useful when the Collective also includes singular words in its
vocab (e.g. ‘grape’ or ‘tin’) so that the player can refer to an
individual grape or tin before any have come into scope. The reason for
this will become clearer when we go on to discuss the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DispensingCollector</code> class.</p>

<p><span id="dispensing"></span></p>

<h2 id="dispensingcollective-class">DispensingCollective Class</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Collective</code> class provides a helpful
framework for helping the parser to choose between a collective (e.g. a
bunch of grapes) and the individual objects for which it is a collective
(e.g. individual grapes), but is otherwise a bit limited in what it can
do. Often, if we have a collective object such as bunch of grapes, we
want the player to be able to take individual items, such as grapes,
from it. For this purpose we can use the <strong>DispensingCollective</strong> class.
This is best explained by way of an example: here’s how we might define
a bunch of grapes from which the player will be allowed to take up to
five grapes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    bunch: DispensingCollective 'bunch of grapes[n]; another more; grape'
        dispensedClass = Grape
        
        maxToDispense = 5       
        
        cannotDispenseMsg = '{I}{\'ve} had quite enough grapes. '
        notEnoughLeftMsg = '{I} {don\'t need} that many grapes. '
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a number of points to note here. First, the word ‘grape’ is
included as an addition noun in the noun section of the vocab property.
This allows the player to type TAKE GRAPE even when there are no
individual grapes in scope, since the Collective (bunch) object will
match ‘grape’. When it matches, however, its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collectiveDobjMatch</code> property will be set to
nil, since it did not match on any of the tokens on the bunch’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collectiveToks</code> property. This tells the bunch
object that the player wants to take an individual grape from the bunch
rather than the whole bunch. We don’t have to do anything to make this
happen; this behaviour is all defined on the DispensingCollective class,
so that the command TAKE GRAPE (or TAKE GRAOE FROM BUNCH) will result in
the bunch object creating a new object of the Grape class and moving
into the player character’s inventory.</p>

<p>Once a separate grape object exists, however, (and while it’s in scope
at the same time as the bunch), the parser will take TAKE GRAPE (or any
other command using the singular GRAPE) to refer to the loose grape
rather than the bunch of grapes. That’s why it’s a good idea to add
words like ‘another’ and ‘more’ as adjectives for the bunch object.
Since the individual, loose grapes don’t have these words in their
vocab, commands like TAKE ANOTHER GRAPE or TAKE TWO MORE GRAPES must
refer to the bunch object, and not to a Grape object, and so the result
will be that the bunch once again creates and dispenses a new Grape to
the player character (or, two grapes, if the command was TAKE TWO MORE
GRAPES).</p>

<p><span id="max"></span></p>

<p>Presumably we don’t, however, want the player to be able to take an
infinite number of grapes from the bunch, so that’s where the
<strong>maxToDispense</strong> property comes in. This property defines the maximum
number of grapes the player will be allowed to take from the bunch. If
the player tries to take more then the bunch will complain using either
its <strong>cannotDispenseMsg</strong>, if the player has taken the maximum number of
grapes, or the <strong>notEnoughLeftMsg</strong> if there are still some grapes left
to take but the player wants to take more than that number (e.g. TAKE
THREE GRAPES when only two remain). The library does define default
messages for both these properties, but they are sufficiently bland that
you’ll normally want to override them with your own (it’s impossible to
know in general the precise reason why you might want to restrict the
number of items to issue to the specific number you choose).</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, the <strong>dispensedClass</strong> method is used to tell
the Collective what class of object to create when the player wants it
to dispense an individual object. As an alternative you can use the
<strong>dispensedObjs</strong> property to hold a list of the objects that the
Collective will dispense. For example, if you only wanted to allow the
player to take a single grape from the bunch, then instead of defining a
Grape class you could define a single grape object and the bunch thus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    bunch: DispensingCollective 'bunch of grapes[n]; another more; grape'
        dispensedObjs = [grape]
           
        
        cannotDispenseMsg = '{I}{\'ve} had quite enough grapes. '
        notEnoughLeftMsg = '{I} {don\'t need} that many grapes. '
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that in this instance there’s no need to define the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maxToDispense</code> property, since the maximum
number of objects that can be dispensed is simply the length of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dispensedObjs</code> list. Note finally that whether
you define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dispensedClass</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dispensedObjs</code>, there is no need to define the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isCollectiveFor(obj)</code> method on a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DispensingCollective</code>, since it this method is
already defined there, and can figure out whether <em>obj</em> is something the
DispensingCollective is a collective for from its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dispensedClass</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dispensedObjs</code> property.</p>

<p><span id="exhaust"></span></p>

<p>The <strong>exhaustDispenser()</strong> provides a further way to customize the
behaviour of a DispensingCollective. It’s called when the
DispensingCollective dispenses its final item. By default it does
nothing, but it can easily be overridden to carry out some side-effect
of running out of items to dispense, such as changing the description,
for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    bunch: DispensingCollective 'bunch of grapes[n]; another more ;grape'
        dispensedClass = Grape
        
        maxToDispense = 5       
        
        cannotDispenseMsg = '{I}{\'ve} had quite enough grapes. '
        notEnoughLeftMsg = '{I} {don\'t need} that many grapes. '
        
        exhaustDispenser()
        {
            setMethod(&amp;desc, 'The bunch is looking a bit depleted; there aren\'t
                really any grapes left that are worth taking. ');        
        }
    ; 
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we had been dealing with a bunch of bananas rather than a bunch of
grapes, the effect of taking the last banana from the bunch (when there
are two bananas left) would be to leave a single banana behind, so we
might do something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     bananaBunch: DispensingCollective 'bunch of bananas[n]; another more; banana'
        "There are &lt;&lt;spellNumber(numLeft)&gt;&gt; bananas left on the bunch. "
        
        dispensedClass = Banana

        maxToDispense = 5
        
        exhaustDispenser()
        {
            local b = new Banana;
            b.moveInto(location);
            moveInto(nil);
        }
    ;
     
</code></pre></div></div>
