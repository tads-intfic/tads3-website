<h1 id="responding-to-actions">Responding to Actions</h1>

<p>In the previous section we taught the game how to respond in general to
commands like PUSH STICK FORWARD and TURN WHEEL TO PORT, but we’ve yet
to get the wheel and the stick to respond in a customized way
appropriate to their role in the game. This will be our next task.</p>

<h2 id="turning-the-wheel">Turning the Wheel</h2>

<p>For the moment we’ll just worry about what effect turning the wheel has
on the wheel. We’ll worry about what it might do to the plane later.</p>

<p>To keep things reasonably but not absurdly simple, we’ll assume the
wheel can be turned to one of five positions: amidships, 30 degrees to
port or starboard, or 60 degrees to port or starboard. We’ll also assume
that a TURN WHEEL LEFT/RIGHT command should turn it 30 degrees at a
time. To keep track of where the wheel is currently turned to we’ll
define a custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">angle</code> property on the wheel
object, which will be allowed to vary from -60 (hard to port) to +60
(hard to starboard). To help the player keep track of the wheel we’ll
also define a custom angleDesc() method that turns this angle into a
description that can be used both in the description of the wheel (in
response to EXAMINE WHEEL) and in the response to a TURN WHEEL LEFT or
TURN WHEEL RIGHT command.</p>

<p>To prevent the wheel from being turned too far to the right or left,
we’ll use the check() phase of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dobjFor(TurnRight)</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dobjFor(TurnLeft)</code>. The former will stop the
action if angle is already greater than or equal to 60, and the latter
will stop the action if angle is already less than or equal to -60.</p>

<p>In the action() stages of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dobjFor(TurnRight)</code>
or do<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bjFor(TurnLeft)</code> we then merely need to
add or subtract 30 to or from angle and report the result. You will
recall that displaying text at the action() stage suppresses the display
of the default message we defined for the report() stage.</p>

<p>The code to do all this is quite lengthy, but basically quite
straightforward:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    +++ wheel: Fixture 'wheel'
        "The wheel can be turned to port or starboard to steer the aircraft. It's
        currently &lt;&lt;angleDesc&gt;&gt;. "
        
        isTurnable = true
        angle = 0
        
        angleDesc()
        {
            switch(angle)
            {
            case -60:
                "hard to port";
                break;
            case -30:
                "slightly to port";
                break;
            case 0:
                "amidships";
                break;
            case 30:
                "slightly to starboard";
                break;
            case 60:
                "hard to starboard";
                break;
            }
        }
        
        dobjFor(TurnRight)
        {
            check()
            {
                if(angle &gt;= 60)
                    "It's already turned as far to starboard as it will go. ";
            }
            
            action()
            {
                angle += 30;
                "You turn the wheel 30 degrees to starboard so that it ends up
                &lt;&lt;angleDesc&gt;&gt;. ";
            }
        }
        
        dobjFor(TurnLeft)
        {
            check()
            {
                if(angle &lt;= -60)
                    "It's already turned as far to port as it will go. ";            
            }
            
            action()
            {
                angle -= 30;
                "You turn the wheel 30 degrees to port so that it ends up
                &lt;&lt;angleDesc&gt;&gt;. ";
            }
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One new feature to note here is the use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">angle +=
30</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">angle -= 30</code> as a convenient
shorthand way of adding 30 to angle and subtracting 30 from angle. As
previously mentioned, all a check() method needs to do to stop an action
is to display some text, which these check methods do if the wheel’s
already turned one way or the other as far as it will go. We’re better
off using check() rather than verify() not only because it happens to be
a bit more convenient, but also because even when the wheel’s turned as
far as it will go it’s still the best choice of object for a TurnRight
or TurnLeft command, so we don’t actually want to rule it out as
illogical at the verify() stage.</p>

<p>There’s one further refinement we could add here, since the player might
reasonably try PUSH WHEEL or PULL WHEEL to mean PUSH CONTROL COLUMN or
PULL CONTROL COLUMN. It would therefore make sense to redirect pushing
or pulling the wheel to pushing or pulling the control column (of which
it is in any case a part), which we can do quite simply with remap:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        dobjFor(Push)
        {
            remap = controlColumn
        }
        
        dobjFor(Pull)
        {
            remap = controlColumn
        }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remap = controlColumn</code> does is simply to
tell the game to use controlColumn rather than the object actually
specified (in this case, the wheel) as the direct object of a Push or
Pull command.</p>

<h2 id="pulling-and-pushing-the-stick">Pulling and Pushing the Stick</h2>

<p>To keep things reasonably simple we’ll allow the control column to take
one of only three different positions: pulled back, vertical or pushed
forward. For the purposes of this game this should be quite sufficient.
The implementation of the Push and Pull actions on the control column
can then proceed in a very similar manner to that of the turning actions
on the wheel:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ++ controlColumn: Fixture 'control column;;stick'
        "It's basically a stick that can be pushed forward or pulled back, with a
        wheel attached at the top. It's currently &lt;&lt;positionDesc&gt;&gt;. "
        listOrder = 10
        
        position = 0
        
        positionDesc = ['pulled right back', 'vertical', 
          'pushed all the way forward'][position + 2]
        
        dobjFor(Push)
        {
            check()
            {
                if(position &gt; 0)
                    "It's already pushed forward as far as it will go. ";
            }
            
            action()
            {
                position++;
                "You push the control column so that it's now &lt;&lt;positionDesc&gt;&gt;. ";
            }
        }
        
        dobjFor(Pull)
        {
            check()
            {
                if(position &lt; 0)
                    "It's already pulled back as far as it will go. ";
            }
            
            action()
            {
                position--;
                "You pull the control column so that it's now &lt;&lt;positionDesc&gt;&gt;. ";
            }
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This shouldn’t require a lot of comment. Note the use of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position++</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position--</code> to increment and decrement the
value of the position property by 1. You’ll probably have already
guessed that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position</code> is a custom property
we’ve defined on the controlColumn object for the purpose of registering
its position. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">positionDesc</code> property uses a
neat trick to turn the value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position</code>
property into a string describing it. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\['pulled
back', 'vertical', 'pushed forward'\]</code> is a list containing three
elements. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\['pulled back', 'vertical', 'pushed
forward'\]\[*index*\]</code> returns the <em>index</em>th element from that
list. By adding 2 to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position</code> we get an index
that varies from 1 to 3 as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position</code> varies
from -1 to 1. With just a little more arithmetical manipulation we could
have used a similar device to turn the wheel angle into a description
instead of using the switch statement on the wheel.</p>

<p>At the moment pushing and pulling the stick doesn’t affect anything but
the stick. We’ll come back to its effect on the plane in the next
section.</p>

<h2 id="pulling-and-pushing-the-thrust-lever">Pulling and Pushing the Thrust Lever</h2>

<p>Finally, we come to the thrust lever, which is notionally meant to
control the power output of the aircraft’s engine(s). We could simply
more or less repeat what we did in the implementation of the control
column, but it would be more interesting to do something a little
different. Let’s suppose that the thrust lever can be in one of six
positions, arbitrarily labeled 0 to 5. Rather than making the player
type PUSH LEVER five times in succession to move the lever all the way
forward (surely rather unrealistic in any case), let’s suppose that the
lever can be moved to the desired position directly with a command like
MOVE LEVER TO 2 or PUSH LEVER TO 4. But let’s suppose that we also want
PUSH LEVER (by itself, without any particular position specified) to
push the lever all the way forward to full thrust, i.e. the 5 setting,
and PULL LEVER to move it all the way back to 0.</p>

<p>With this setup, the thrust lever has a kind of binary mode with just
PULL and PUSH (all the way back or all the way forward) and also a
multi-setting mode in which it can be moved to any setting between 0 and</p>
<ol>
  <li>The library defines a Lever class for a binary kind of lever and a
Settable class for a control that can be set to a number of different
settings. Fortunately we can combine the two through multiple
inheritance:</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ++ thrustLever: Settable, Lever 'thrust lever'
        "It's a lever that can be pushed forward or pulled back. It's currently
        &lt;&lt;settingDesc&gt;&gt;. "
        listOrder = 20
        
        settingDesc()
        {
            switch(curSetting)
            {
            case '0':
                return 'pulled all the way back to 0';
            case '5':
                return 'pushed all the way forward to 5';
            default:
                return 'in the &lt;&lt;curSetting&gt;&gt; position';
            }
        }
        
        curSetting = '0'
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curSetting</code> property (a
property of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settable</code>) to hold the current
setting (which Settable expects to find as a single-quoted string) and
define a custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">settingDesc()</code> method to use a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switch</code> statement that translates the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curSetting</code> value into a fuller textual
description of the current position of the lever.</p>

<p>We want to restrict the possible settings of the lever to numbers
between 0 and 5. A NumberedDial will do that for us, but a Lever isn’t a
NumberedDial, and neither is a Settable. Fortunately there’s a little
trick TADS 3 lets us play if we want to “borrow” a method from a class
the object we’re defining doesn’t inherit from. We can do so using the
<strong>delegated</strong> keyword, followed by the name of the class whose method we
want to borrow. Here we want to borrow the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isValidSetting()</code> method of the NumberedDial
class to ensure that the lever can only be moved to numbers between 0
and 5. We don’t need to use delegated with the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minSetting</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maxSetting</code> properties we’re also “borrowing”
from NumberedDial, since they’re just straightforward numerical
properties we can define directly on our thrustLever. The definition of
thrustLever can thus continue like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        minSetting = 0
        maxSetting = 5
        
        isValidSetting(val)
        {
            return delegated NumberedDial(val);
        }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more information on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delegated</code> keyword,
refer to the “Expressions and Operators” section of Part III of the
<em>TADS 3 System Manual</em>.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll probably want moving the thrust lever to be reported with
something a little less bland than “You set the thrust lever to n”,
especially if the engine is running. We can do that by providing our
custom message in the makeSetting() method:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        makeSetting(val)
        {
            local oldVal = curSetting;
            inherited(val);
            "You &lt;&lt;if oldVal &lt; val&gt;&gt; push the thrust lever forward&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; pull the
            lever back&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; to &lt;&lt;curSetting&gt;&gt;. ";
            
            if(ignitionButton.isOn)
            {
                "The whine of the engine &lt;&lt;if oldVal &lt; val&gt;&gt;increases &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
                decreases&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; in pitch and volume&lt;&lt;if val=='0'&gt;&gt;, dying away to
                a barely perceptible whisper&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;. ";
            }
            
        }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oldVal</code> local variable to store
the previous setting so we can test which way the player has just moved
the lever when we want to display an appropriate message. We also use
the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ignitionButton.isOn</code> to test
whether the engine is running, so that if it is we can display a
description of the change in engine noise that results from moving the
thrust lever. We don’t need to worry about the case where the player
tries to move the lever to the same setting it’s already at, since the
verify() stage of SetTo will rule that out anyway. Also we don’t need to
worry about the default message the action would have displayed, since
our custom message automatically suppresses anything that would have
been displayed at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">report</code> stage.</p>

<p>The next job is to tie in the Lever’s push/pull behaviour with the
Settable behaviour we’ve just implemented. A Lever can be in one of two
states, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isPulled = nil</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isPulled = true</code>. For this Lever we want the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isPulled = true</code> state (when the thrust lever
is pulled all the way back) to correspond to curSetting of ‘0’, and the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isPushed = true</code> state (when the lever is
pushed all the way forward) to correspond to a curSetting of ‘5’. By
default the Lever class assumes that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isPushed</code>
is true when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isPulled</code> is nil and <em>vice versa</em>,
so we need to override those two properties to cancel that assumption,
and completely change what the Lever’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makePulled()</code> method normally does:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>        makePulled(stat)
        {        
            makeSetting(stat ? '0' : '5');
        }
        
        isPulled = (curSetting == '0')
        isPushed = (curSetting == '5')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The complete definition of the thrustLever object now looks as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ++ thrustLever: Settable, Lever 'thrust lever'
        "It's a lever that can be pushed forward or pulled back. It's currently
        &lt;&lt;settingDesc&gt;&gt;. "
        listOrder = 20
        
        settingDesc()
        {
            switch(curSetting)
            {
            case '0':
                return 'pulled all the way back to 0';
            case '5':
                return 'pushed all the way forward to 5';
            default:
                return 'in the &lt;&lt;curSetting&gt;&gt; position';
            }
        }
        
        curSetting = '0'
        minSetting = 0
        maxSetting = 5
        
        isValidSetting(val)
        {
            return delegated NumberedDial(val);
        }
        
        makeSetting(val)
        {
            local oldVal = curSetting;
            inherited(val);
            "You &lt;&lt;if oldVal &lt; val&gt;&gt; push the thrust lever forward&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; pull the
            lever back&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; to &lt;&lt;curSetting&gt;&gt;. ";
            
            if(ignitionButton.isOn)
            {
                "The whine of the engine &lt;&lt;if oldVal &lt; val&gt;&gt;increases &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
                decreases&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; in pitch and volume&lt;&lt;if val=='0'&gt;&gt;, dying away to
                a barely perceptible whisper&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;. ";
            }
            
        }
        
        makePulled(stat)
        {        
            makeSetting(stat ? '0' : '5');
        }
        
        isPulled = (curSetting == '0')
        isPushed = (curSetting == '5')
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We still have one further job to do. At the moment the thrust lever will
respond to commands like SET LEVER TO 3 but we’d also like to respond to
MOVE LEVER TO 3, or PUSH LEVER TO 3 or PULL LEVER TO 3. We’ve already
seen how to accomplish that sort of thing in another context, namely by
modifying the appropriate VerbRule:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify VerbRule(SetTo)
        ('set' | 'move' | 'push' | 'pull') singleDobj 'to' literalIobj
        :
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve now got the controls to the point where they can be operated, even
if we can’t yet fly the plane with them. In the next section we’ll make
it possible for the plane to take off.</p>
