<h1 id="listening-to-the-bird">Listening to the Bird</h1>

<p>The very simple game we implemented in Chapter 3 is just about all right
— provided all its players do exactly what we expect them to. As soon as
any of them depart from our expected script, problems may begin to
emerge. For example, consider this opening transcript which could well
be generated by someone playing the game:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In front of a Cottage
You stand outside a cottage. The forest stretches east. 

&gt;e

Deep in the forest
Through the dense foliage, you glimpse a building to the west. A track heads to the northeast. 

You can see a baby bird here.

&gt;x bird
Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. 

&gt;listen to bird
You hear nothing out of the ordinary.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the description of the bird calls attention to the sound it’s
making, this final response is rather jarring; most players would take
it as evidence of a poorly-implemented game. While “You hear nothing out
of the ordinary” is okay as a default response to commands like LISTEN
TO NEST or LISTEN TO TREE, it just won’t pass muster here. It’s easy
enough to put right, though; all we need to do is to override the
<strong>listenDesc</strong> property of the bird to provide a more satisfactory
response:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + bird: Thing 'baby bird;;nestling'
        "Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. "
           
        bulk = 1
        
        listenDesc = "The nestling sounds scared and in need of assistance. "
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now all should be well. If you recompile the game and try to listen to
the bird you should now see a more appropriate response. Incidentally,
you should get precisely the same response if you just enter the command
LISTEN in the presence of the bird, since this displays the listenDescs
(if not nil) of all the audible items in scope (on the assumption that
the player wants a report of all the sounds in the vicinity). That’s why
we defined listenDesc as “The nestling sounds scared and in need of
assistance” rather than “It sounds scared and in need of assistance”,
since the latter wouldn’t make so much sense if the player had just
typed LISTEN.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you didn’t want the bird’s tweeting to be reported in
response to a bare LISTEN command, you could define
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isProminentNoise = nil</code> on the bird.</p>

<p>You can deal with SMELL, FEEL and TASTE in exactly the same way, by
defining <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smellDesc</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feelDesc</code> and/or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tasteDesc</code> on the appropriate objects.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smellDesc</code> works just like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listenDesc</code>, in that a bare SMELL command will
report the smellDescs of everything in the vicinity that has one
(provided its isProminentSmell property is true). This doesn’t happen
with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feelDesc</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tasteDesc</code> however, since the intransitive
commands FEEL and TASTE wouldn’t make much sense.</p>
