<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Over the course of this tutorial we’ve introduced most of the features
of the adv3Lite library and some of the most common features of the TADS
3 language. To do this we’ve walked through the implementation of three
adv3Lite games, two very short and simple, the third a bit longer and
more complex (though still quite small by the standards of most typical
IF). If you’ve faithfully followed this tutorial all the way to the end,
typing in and trying out the code as you’ve gone along, and maybe trying
a few things on your own as well (such as the “exercises best left to
the interested reader”), then you should now be in a strong position to
start writing your own game.</p>

<p>But don’t worry if it doesn’t all seem entirely plain sailing at first.
Not everything about writing IF is easy, and if you’re at all ambitious,
sooner or later you’re probably going to attempt something quite
difficult. My best advice is not to try to tackle something too
difficult too soon, but first concentrate on implementing the more
straightforward parts of the game. Attempting to run before one has
fully mastered the art of walking is one of the most common sources of
frustration among new IF authors (people don’t always like my pointing
this out, but there really is no point in pretending otherwise). Still,
at some point you will almost certainly want to tackle something more
challenging, and of course if you’re ever going to progress as an IF
author it’s quite right and proper that you should do so.</p>

<p>If you find yourself running into trouble (of course I hope you don’t,
but <em>some</em> people do) then consider taking the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have fully analysed the problem you’re trying to
solve. Maybe breaking it down into a series of smaller steps will
help.</li>
  <li>Look back over this tutorial, or over the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>
or the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em> to see if you can find a possible
solution, or at least to ensure you fully understand the feature(s)
of the system you’re trying to use.</li>
  <li>Make use of the debugging tools provided, either in Windows
Workbench (if you’re using it) or (or additionally) those provided
by <a href="../manual/debug.html">adv3Lite</a>. They may help you track down
what’s going awry.</li>
  <li>Take a look at the library source code to see if that can help you
figure out what’s going on.</li>
  <li>Seek help on the TADS forum of
<a href="http://www.intfiction.org/forum/index.php">Intfiction.org</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course most of the time you shouldn’t run into any problems at all,
and though it’s a lot of work to produce a well polished work of IF of
any size, you should find that doing so in adv3Lite is reasonably
straightforward. I hope you enjoy using adv3Lite when you come to use it
for your own projects.</p>
