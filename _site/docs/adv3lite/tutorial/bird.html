<h1 id="adding-the-bird-and-the-nest">Adding the Bird and the Nest</h1>

<p>We have already defined one object in the game that isn’t a room: the me
object that defines the player character. This is a slightly unusual
object because it has to act as the player character, so it’s necessary
to define several properties on it you wouldn’t normally need to use
elsewhere. That’s why it’s predefined for you in the template file you
copied when first setting up your source files for the Heidi game, so
that you wouldn’t have to worry about it. We might take a quick look at
it, however, before going on to define the objects that will represent
the bird and the nest:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + me: Thing 'you;;heidi'   
        isFixed = true    
        proper = true
        ownsContents = true
        person = 2   
        contType = Carrier    
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the definition starts with a + sign. This indicates that the
object that’s about to be defined is initially located within the
immediately preceding object that has one fewer plus signs (in this
case, that means no plus signs at all, so the room where me starts out
is beforeCottage, the starting location). The programmatic name of the
object is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">me</code>, which comes next. Following the
colon is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thing</code>, the class to which the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">me</code> object belongs. You might think it’s odd
that the player character should be a mere Thing, but adv3Lite makes
this possible (it wouldn’t be in adv3, for example) provided we go on to
define the properties that follow.</p>

<p>The first property that’s defined is the <strong>vocab</strong> property, though this
is done implicitly via a template (i.e. we don’t need to explicitly
write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab = 'you;;heidi'</code>). We’ll explain
this property in a bit more detail below, but for now we’ll just say
that defining it this way means that the me object is called ‘you’ in
text that appears in the interpreter and can also be referred to as
‘heidi’ by the player. The next definition, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isFixed =
true</code>, means that me object isn’t something that can be picked up
and carried around (although, obviously, this doesn’t stop it moving
around of its own accord, as we’ve already seen: moving the me object
around is precisely what happens when the player character moves from
one room to another). Defining <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isFixed = true</code>
also has the effect of preventing the me object appearing as an item in
room listings: you don’t want your players to see “You can see you here”
and defining the isFixed property as true prevents that from happpening.
The next line, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proper = true</code>, ensures that the
me object is never referred to with an article (we don’t want the game
producing text like “You see a you here” or “You can’t do that to the
you”; such text probably wouldn’t occur anyway, but it’s best to make
sure). Then comes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ownsContents = true</code>, which
means that the me object can be regarded as the owner of anything
located within it (so that, for example, the player can refer to “my
bag” and the parser should be able to tell which bag is meant). Then
comes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">person = 2</code> which tells the parser that
we’re going to tell the game from a second-person perspective, so that,
for example, the game will generate messages like “You can’t do that”
rather than “I can’t do that” or “Heidi can’t do that.” If you wanted to
write a game in the first person or the third person you could change
person to 1 or 3, but this isn’t an option we’ll be exploring any
further here. Finally we define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contType =
Carrier</code>, which means that the me object is to be regarded as
carrying any objects located within in it (for example if we had gone on
to define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">++ bag: Thing 'bag';</code> on the next
line, Heidi would be carrying the bag).</p>

<p>Don’t worry if you’re not entirely sure you’ve grasped all of that just
yet. As we said above, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">me</code> object is
something of a special case. We’ll now go on to define a couple of
objects that are rather more typical of the things you’ll normally be
defining in a game, namely the bird and its nest. We’ll start with the
bird, which should look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + bird: Thing 'baby bird;;nestling'
        "Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. "
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Type this code in immediately after the definition of the forest room,
so that the bird starts out in the middle of the forest.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at this definition a little more closely. Once again
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bird</code> is the programmatic name of the object
(the name by which we can refer to it elsewhere in our code), and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thing</code> is the class to which it belongs (which
defines a whole bunch of standard behaviour that may be far from
apparent at first sight, as we’ll soon see). The two properties we’ve
then gone on to define are the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab</code> property
and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desc</code> property. It’s exactly the same
as if we’d written:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + bird: Thing 
        vocab = 'baby bird;;nestling'
        desc = "Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. "
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But since we’re likely to define these two properties on virtually every
Thing we create in our game, the library template allows us the shortcut
of omitting the explicit property names, as shown above, so we’ll use
the short-form definition for every Thing we create from now on (or at
least, wherever we can). Note, however, that when we use a template, we
do have to define the properties in the right order. Neither of the
following definitions would work:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + bird: Thing 
        "Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. "
    ;

    + bird: Thing  "Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. "    
        'baby bird;;nestling'
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first won’t work because we’ve missed out the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab</code> property altogether. The second won’t
work because we’ve tried to define the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desc</code>
property before the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab</code> property, and that
won’t match the template. As it so happens, though, you can define
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab</code> without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desc</code>,
so the following would be legal (though not normally advisable):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + bird: Thing 'baby bird;;nestling'
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But what do the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desc</code> properties actually do? The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">desc</code> property is probably the simpler to
explain; it simply defines the description the game will show when the
player types EXAMINE BIRD or the equivalent:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;x bird
Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab</code> property is a bit more complex,
because it actually provides a way of defining several properties at
once. The format of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab</code> property in full
is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>       vocab = 'article name; additional adjectives; additional nouns; pronoun'
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But we don’t need to define all these sections if we don’t need them
all. In the case of the bird we’ve defined the name (‘baby bird’) and an
additional noun (‘nestling’). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> is the
name by which the parser will refer to this object in text displayed to
the player (e.g. “You see a baby bird here.”). At the same time the
library assumes that since this object is called ‘baby bird’, the player
should be able to use ‘baby’, ‘bird’ and ‘baby bird’ to refer to it (in
fact any combination of the words ‘baby’ and ‘bird’ will work; if the
player insists on typing X BIRD BABY BABY BIRD BIRD, the parser will
still know what is meant). However, by default the parser will take
‘baby’ to be an adjective and ‘bird’ to be a noun, and will prefer a
noun match to a purely adjectival match. That means, for example, that
if you had the bird object in the same room as a baby object (with a
name of ‘young baby’, say), the command X BABY would select the (human)
baby rather than the baby bird.</p>

<p>Since the description of the bird uses the word ‘nestling’, the player
could use the word ‘nestling’ to refer to the bird, and we need to
ensure that the parser will recognize it. We therefore add it as an
additional noun (i.e. a noun that can be used to refer to the bird but
doesn’t form part of its name). We do so here by leaving the additional
adjectives section blank (by simply typing two semicolons together) and
then adding ‘nestling’. If we wanted to add a pronoun (such as ‘it’) we
could then type a further semicolon and the word ‘it’, but since the
adv3Lite library assumes every Thing is an ‘it’ by default we don’t need
to. If we wanted to define a feminine, masculine or plural object we
could define the pronoun as ‘her’, ‘him’ or ‘them’ respectively, and all
the appropriate properties would be set for us.</p>

<p>If you want the full story on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab</code>
property, which looks pretty complex at first, but which can save you a
lot of time in the long run, you can find it in the <a href="../manual/thing.html#vocab">adv3Lite library
manual</a>.</p>

<p>Now let’s define the nest. This starts out in the clearing, so you
should type the following immediately after the definition of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clearing</code> room:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + nest: Thing 'bird\'s nest; carefully woven; moss twigs'
        "The nest is carefully woven of twigs and moss. "
        
        contType = In    
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much of this should be starting to become familiar. The programmatic
name of the nest object is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nest</code>. Once again,
it’s of class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thing</code>. The name of the object
when the parser displays a message about it to the player is “bird’s
nest” and the player can refer to it as “bird’s nest”, “nest” or
“bird’s”. Since the description of the nest refers to moss and twigs we
add these as additional nouns in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vocab</code>
property. The description also talks about them being “carefully woven”,
so we define these two words as additional adjectives (yes, I know
“carefully” is actually an adverb, but we can treat it as an adjective
for the purpose of this object definition, right?); this will allow the
player to refer to a “carefully woven nest” or whatever.</p>

<p>Note the backslash (\ before the apostrophe in ‘bird\s nest’. If we
had simply written ‘bird’s nest; carefully woven; moss twigs’, then it
would have appeared to the compiler that the `
vocab<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> property ended immediately after 'bird' and it wouldn't
have known what to do with </code>s nest; carefully woven;
moss twigs’`, and a whole spate of compiler errors would have
resulted. When we want to use an apostrophe or single-quote mark inside
a single-quoted string, as here, we thus have to <em>escape</em> it with the
<em>escape character</em>, which in TADS 3 is the backslash (\. The backslash
can also be used to escape a double-quote mark (“) inside a
double-quoted string, as well as a number of other special characters.</p>

<p>Finally, note that we have given the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contType</code>
property the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">In</code>. Think of contType as
standing for “containment type”. Defining ` contType =
In<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> means that anything located within the nest (using the +
syntax or its various equivalents) is to be regarded as being *inside*
the nest (as opposed to being on it, under it, behind it, attached to it
or whatever). The definition </code>contType = In`
thus makes the nest a <em>container</em>. We need the nest to be a container
since Heidi needs to be able to put the bird back <em>in</em> its nest.</p>

<p>If you now compile and run the game you should find you can do quite a
bit more than you could before. You can now pick up the nest and the
bird and carry them around. You should also be able to put the bird in
the nest. You can also drop the bird and the nest once you’re carrying
them. If you type the INVENTORY command (I for short) while holding the
bird or the nest you’ll see them included in the list of things you’re
carrying. This may not seem like much; the novelty will soon wear off;
but remember that you really haven’t done much to define any of this
behaviour. You’re getting it all for free, as it were, as it’s all
predefined for you on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thing</code> class.</p>
