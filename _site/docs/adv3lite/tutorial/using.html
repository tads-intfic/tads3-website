<h1 id="using-the-tools">Using the Tools</h1>

<p>We’re almost ready to dive in and start writing our first game together,
but before that, we’ll just cover a few more preliminaries. Some of
these will be repeated later, because they’re important, and people
generally need to be reminded more often than they need to be told.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a list of important things to bear in mind when using
the programming tools and files we’ve just set up.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When you write your source code, the compiler needs to be able to
understand what you’ve written.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a compiler does may look very impressive — turning your text
into a working game — but in some respects compilers are very stupid
pieces of software. In particular they are <em>very</em> literal-minded. If
you don’t type exactly what you mean in precisely the format the
compiler expects, it won’t understand you (or it may appear to
understand you while in fact misunderstanding you).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, even if what you meant would be blindingly obvious to
any human reader, the compiler will insist on misunderstanding or
not understanding it if you haven’t said it in precisely the right
way. This can be very annoying and frustrating when the compiler
tells you about some missing semicolon or comma without making any
attempt to correct the obvious mistake for itself, but that’s
compilers for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And yes, the TADS 3 compiler is very particular about things like
commas and semicolons and other such punctuation marks. When you’re
typing in code from the samples given in subsequent chapters, be
very sure to get such details <em>exactly</em> right, or the compiler won’t
understand you (and will probably reject your code with one or more
complaints of syntax errors, which you’ll have to fix before you can
get your game to compile at all).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The TADS 3 compiler also distinguishes between upper and lower case
letters. To TADS 3, heidi, HEIDI and Heidi are three completely
different and unrelated identifiers, and if you type one of them
when you mean another, the compiler won’t understand you. So be very
careful to copy the case of letters <em>exactly</em> when working through
the chapters that follow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The compiler isn’t so fussy about text and punctuation that appears
between quote marks (‘ and ‘, or “ and “) since generally this is
just text that’s going to be displayed to the player, not commands
that are meant to be meaningful to the compiler. But in some cases
(e.g. when defining vocab properties and embedded expresssions)
getting it exactly right can still be critical if you want things to
work the way you expect, so you still get into the habit of being
careful in your transcription.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general the compiler isn’t at all fussy about what you do with
white space (spaces, tabs, newlines and the like). So far as the
compiler is concerned the following two code samples are exactly
equivalent:</p>

    <p>`
    + nest: Thing ‘bird's nest; carefully woven; moss twigs’
        “The nest is carefully woven of twigs and moss. “</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    contType = In   
    bulk = 1
;
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>and:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>+ nest: Thing 'bird\'s nest; carefully woven; moss twigs' "The nest is carefully woven of twigs and moss. "    
    contType = In bulk = 1;
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>It’s just that the first way of doing it is much more readable to
the human eye (and hence much less error-prone) than the second, so
you should get into the habit of laying out your code the first way.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The other thing to note is that in addition to Workbench, or to your
text editor and compiler, your other important tools are the various
forms of documentation. In additition to this tutorial the important
ones are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <a href="..\manual\index.html">adv3Lite Library Manual</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="..\sysman.html">TADS 3 System Manual</a></li>
  <li>A few sections of the <em>TADS 3 Technical Manual</em> (though most of it
is directed towards the adv3 library)</li>
  <li>The adv3Lite library source code and the comments it contains (in
the fullness of time it would be nice to have an adv3Lite version of
the <em>Library Reference Manual</em>, but that doesn’t exist yet).</li>
</ol>

<p>In the chapters that follow they’ll be pointers to further information
you can find in all these sources. You certainly don’t need to look them
up straight away, but you will need to do so eventually.
