<h1 id="everything-in-its-place">Everything in its place</h1>

<h2 id="starting-out-right">Starting Out Right</h2>

<p>In the original version of the Goldskull game, which we began by
reproducing, the rock starts out inside the cave, conveniently waiting
to be placed on a pedestal. In a real game you probably wouldn’t want to
make the solution to the problem quite so obvious. In this two-room game
the only other place to put the rock (unless we want to hide it
somewhere, which we won’t attempt here) is in the starting location.
While we’re at it we may as well move the pebble there too. We’ll also
introduce a new property, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initSpecialDesc</code>.
This determines the way an item is first described in a room listing,
until the item is moved. Try moving the rock and the pebble into
startroom and adding an initSpecialDesc to the rock like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + smallRock: Thing 'small rock; round solid'
         "It's roughly round and looks pretty solid. "
        
        initSpecialDesc = "A small rock lies on the ground near the mouth of the
            cave, evidence, perhaps, of long-term erosion. "
        
        weight = 10
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you’ve made these changes, try recompiling and running the game.
You should now see the following as the description of the starting
location on the first turn:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Outside Cave
Youre standing in the bright sunlight just outside of a large, dark, foreboding cave, which lies to the north.
The path back to your camp winds roughly southeast through the dense foliage. 

A small rock lies on the ground near the mouth of the cave, evidence, perhaps, of long-term erosion. 

You can see a tiny pebble here.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is arguably both better and worse than just displaying “You see a
small rock and a tiny pebble here.” It’s better insofar as the longer
sentence about the small rock is more atmospheric, but worse in that it
then makes the sentence about the tiny pebble look just a little
incongruous. What would we be even better would be if we could combine
the mention of both objects into a single sentence. Here’s one way we
can do it:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + smallRock: Thing 'small rock; round solid'
         "It's roughly round and looks pretty solid. "
        
        initSpecialDesc = "A small rock &lt;&lt;if pebble.moved&gt;&gt;lies &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; and
            &lt;&lt;mention a pebble&gt;&gt; lie &lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; on the ground near the mouth of the
            cave, evidence, perhaps, of long-term erosion. "
        
        weight = 10
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s look at how this works. The smallRock will use its initSpecialDesc
until it has been moved. When a Thing is moved (via a call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actionMoveInto()</code>, which is generally used in
the handling of any player command that causes an object to be moved)
its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moved</code> property is set to true. We can thus
use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pebble.moved</code> to test whether the pebble
has been moved or whether it’s still resting by the mouth of the cave
next to the rock. If the pebble has been moved, then
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smallRock.initSpecialDesc</code> just describes the
rock as lying there, but if the pebble hasn’t been moved yet it mentions
the pebble as well.</p>

<p>The subtle touch is using the embedded expression
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;mention a pebble\&gt;\&gt;</code> to display the text
‘a pebble’ in the course of this description. What this does is not only
to tell the game to provide the name of the pebble with the indefinite
article (‘a pebble’) but also to note that the pebble has already been
mentioned in the room description so it doesn’t need to be mentioned
again, thus suppressing the additional line “You see a small pebble
here.” Once either the pebble or the rock is moved, this changes, as the
following transcript illustrates:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Outside Cave

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may find this combination of techniques useful for getting your room
descriptions starting out just the way you want.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initSpecialDesc</code> has a close relative called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">specialDesc</code>, the difference being that
specialDesc displays all the time (whether the object it has been
defined on has been moved or not — actually that’s not strictly true
since you can control when both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">specialDesc</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">initSpecialDesc</code> are used, but that’s a
complication we’ll leave aside for now). Both initSpecialDesc and
specialDesc are used regardless of the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isFixed</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isListed</code>
on the item in question, so a common use of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">specialDesc</code> is to provide a separate
description of a fixed object not otherwise mentioned in the main room
description (particularly when we want to call attention to the object
rather than letting it merge into the overall description of the room).</p>

<p>Consider the description of the cave room. As it now appears (with the
rock and pebble moved outside), the player will see:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Cave
Youre inside a dark and musty cave. Sunlight pours in from a passage to the south. 

On the stone pedestal you see a gold skull.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is actually a little odd, since the stone pedestal is only
mentioned as the supporter of the gold skull, yet it’s referred to as
‘the stone pedestal’ as if the player already knows about it. Morever,
if nothing were resting on the pedestal, it wouldn’t be mentioned at all
(admittedly that situation can’t come about in this game without killing
the player, but it still doesn’t seem quite right in principle). Of
course we could simply add a mention of the object to the main room
description, but this seems quite a good opportunity to illustrate the
use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">specialDesc</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + pedestal: Fixture, Surface 'stone pedestal; smooth solitary'
        "The smooth stone pedestal is artfully positioned to catch the sunlight at
        just this time of day. "
            
        specialDesc = "A solitary stone pedestal stands at the centre of the cave. "
        
        notifyRemove(obj)
        {
            gMessageParams(obj);
            
            if(getWeightWithin() - obj.getWeight &lt; goldSkull.weight)
            {
                "As {the subj obj} {leaves} the pedestal, a volley of poisonous
                arrows is shot from the walls! You try to dodge the arrows, but
                they take you by surprise!";  
                
                finishGameMsg(ftDeath, [finishOptionUndo]);  
            }
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The room description then becomes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Cave
Youre inside a dark and musty cave. Sunlight pours in from a passage to the south. 

A solitary stone pedestal stands at the centre of the cave. 

On the stone pedestal you see a gold skull.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is probably an improvement. At least the text makes sense, and at
least the stone pedestal will get a mention even if there’s nothing on
it, but it would be neater if the paragraph about the skull could be
combined with the paragraph about the pedestal. We could try to do with
some combination of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;if
goldSkull.location==pedestal\&gt;\&gt;</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;mention a goldSkull\&gt;\&gt;</code>, but since in
principle all sorts of objects could end up on top of the pedestal, this
approach would pretty soon become quite unwieldy. What we need is some
means of listing all the objects currently on the pedestal, whatever
they happen to be. The following should do the trick:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + pedestal: Fixture, Surface 'stone pedestal; smooth solitary'
        "The smooth stone pedestal is artfully positioned to catch the sunlight at
        just this time of day. "
            
        specialDesc = "A solitary stone pedestal stands at the centre of the
            cave&lt;&lt;if listableContents.length &gt; 0 &gt;&gt;, with &lt;&lt;list of
              listableContents&gt;&gt; resting on top of it&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;. "
        
        notifyRemove(obj)
        {
            gMessageParams(obj);
            
            if(getWeightWithin() - obj.getWeight &lt; goldSkull.weight)
            {
                "As {the subj obj} {leaves} the pedestal, a volley of poisonous
                arrows is shot from the walls! You try to dodge the arrows, but
                they take you by surprise!";  
                
                finishGameMsg(ftDeath, [finishOptionUndo]);  
            }
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listableContents</code> rather than just
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contents</code> to exclude any fixtures or components
that are attached to the pedestal rather than just resting on top of it
(see next subsection). If there are any items in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listableContents</code> list (which we can test by
seeing whether its length is greater than 0) then we append a list of
what they are, in a suitably-worded clause. The embedded expression
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;list of listableContents\&gt;\&gt;</code> both produces
a properly formatted list of whatever’s in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listableContents</code>, it also marks everything in
the list as having been mentioned so it won’t appear in the room
contents listing again. With this definition the room description
becomes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Cave
Youre inside a dark and musty cave. Sunlight pours in from a passage to the south. 

A solitary stone pedestal stands at the centre of the cave, with a gold skull resting on top of it. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are several other ways we can tweak how items are displayed in a
room description listing. For the full story see the section on <a href="../manual/roomdesc.html">Room
Descriptions</a> in the <em>adv3Lite Manual</em>.</p>

<h2 id="giving-due-warning">Giving Due Warning</h2>

<p>As the game stands, it gives very little warning to the player that
taking the gold skull might spring a trap. To be sure both the setting
and the nature of the skull might suggest that a hidden danger is
lurking somewhere, and the wary player might well suspect that just
walking in and taking the skull seems a bit too easy; moreover, if the
player character gets himself killed the player can always UNDO and try
something else, but most modern players of Interactive Fiction tend to
regard such “learning by dying” as rather bad form, and if you want your
game to be respected, it’s better to put some kind of clue or warning of
impending danger that goes beyond relying on your players’ intuition.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of ways we could do that here. If this were part of
a larger game, the player could have been warned of the trap in a
previous episode. Or we could furnish the cave with the grisly remains
of the last adventurer who tried to steal the gold skull. Or we could
call attention to rows of suspicious-looking holes in the walls of the
cave. But what we’ll actually do here is provide the pedestal with a
warning inscription:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + pedestal: Fixture, Surface 'stone pedestal; smooth solitary'
        "The smooth stone pedestal is artfully positioned to catch the sunlight at
        just this time of day, picking out the inscription carved into its front. "
            
        ... 
    ;

    ++ Fixture 'inscription; faded ancient sumerian; lettering script cuneiform'
        "The lettering is quite faded, and the script is in ancient Sumerian
        Cuneiform, but fortunately that's a language you took the trouble to learn,
        and you can just about make it out. "
        
        readDesc = "The inscription reads &lt;q&gt;Whoever dares remove this sacred object
            from its place shall become as that which he desires.&lt;/q&gt; "
        
        weight = 0
        
        cannotTakeMsg = 'You can hardly take the inscription; it\'s part of the
            pedestal. '
        
    ; 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For the sake of brevity we’ve omitted repeating the rest of the
definition of the pedestal. Note that we don’t need to give the
inscription object a programmatic name, since no code ever needs to
refer to it; it’s only one step up from a decoration. We do define a
custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cannotTakeMsg</code>, however, since it seems
better to say that the inscription is part of the pedestal than to say
merely that it’s fixed in place (customizing message properties like
this is a good way to give your game some character and to show that
you’ve taken trouble with it; if all players see is lots of default
messages they probably won’t think much of your efforts). We define
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weight = 0</code> because we don’t want the
inscription to contribute to the weight of objects resting on the
pedestal, as it otherwise would. Note that since we took the trouble to
use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listableContents</code> rather than
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contents</code> above to list what’s on the pedestal,
we’ve averted the danger of the inscription showing up as one of the
things resting on the pedestal (as it otherwise would). It might have
been easier to make the inscription a completely separate object, not
contained in the pedestal at all, and since neither the pedestal nor its
inscription are ever going to move in this game, that would have worked
just fine. In other situations though, it’s possible that something like
the pedestal might be moved, so it’s best to maintain the containment
relationship if possible, to make sure its components (such as the
inscription) will always move with it. It also serves to make the
relationship between the inscription and the pedestal that much clearer
in your code. Note, however, that if we wanted to attach a component to
a Container we might need to take a different approach, because if the
Container were ever to become closed (or started out closed), the
component would be hidden away out of sight inside the Container. We’ll
return to this issue in a later chapter.</p>

<p>&lt;q&gt; and &lt;/q&gt; just give a pair of matching typographical quotes (“
and ”). Of more note is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readDesc</code> property,
which we haven’t met before. If defined on an object, this gives a
response to the command READ WHATEVER (in this case READ INSCRIPTION),
which in general is different from the response to EXAMINE WHATEVER. If
you did want the two to be the same you could just define
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readDesc = (desc)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="pointing-the-way">Pointing the Way</h2>

<p>We’ll just perform one more task before finally leaving the Goldskull
game. You may remember above we said that the way we’d set up the
PathPassage notionally leading back to the camp was something of a
horrible hack. Now we’ll see how it should be done:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    startroom: Room 'Outside Cave'
        desc = "You're standing in the bright sunlight just outside of a large,
            dark, foreboding cave, which lies to the north. The path back to your
            camp winds roughly southeast through the dense foliage. " 
        
        north = cave 
        in asExit(north)
       
        southeast = pathBack
        
    ;

    + pathBack: PathPassage 'overgrown path'
        "The heavily overgrown path runs roughly southeast through the trees. "
        
        canTravelerPass(traveler)
        {
            return goldSkull.isIn(traveler);
        }
        
        explainTravelBarrier(traveler)
        {
            "You've no intention of leaving till you've got what you came for. ";
        }
        
        travelDesc()
        {
            "Your mission complete, you head triumphantly back to your camp. ";
            finishGameMsg(ftVictory, [finishOptionUndo]);
        }    
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you think there’s something vaguely familiar about this, then you’re
right. For one thing, much of the code on the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pathBack</code> object was previously what was
defined on the southeast() method of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">startroom</code>. For another, pointing a direction
property to an object and then defining the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">travelDesc</code> property/method on that object is
something we’ve done before, when we made the tree object in the Heidi
game a StairwayUp. PathPassage and StairwayUp both inherit from the
TravelConnector class (along with the Thing class), and that’s why we’re
seeing a similarity. You can read all about TravelConnectors in the
section on <a href="../manual/travel.html">Travel Connectors and Barriers</a> in the
adv3Lite manual, if you like, but you can glean most of what you need to
know about them from these two examples (the tree and the path). The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canTravelerPass(traveler)</code> method determines
whether <em>traveler</em> is allowed to pass through this TravelConnector; in
this case we allow it if the traveler (which in this game can only be
the player character) is directly or indirectly carrying the gold skull
(he’d be carrying it indirectly if he put the skull in the knapsack and
then carried the knapsack, but using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isIn(traveler)</code> allows for this possibility
too). If we disallow travel, the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">explainTravelBarrier(travel)</code> method is used to
explain why. Finally, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">travelDesc()</code> method
can be used to define the side-effects of travel, in this case
displaying a message and then ending the game in victory.</p>

<p>Can you notice anything that seems to be missing from this new version
of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pathBack</code> object? You may remember that
on the tree object in the Heidi game we defined
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">destination = topOfTree</code> to control where the
player character went when the tree was climbed. Ordinarily we’d do the
same here, but since the game is ended before the player character can
actually end up anywhere else, there’s no point, so we can leave the
destination of pathBack as nil. If we actually wanted to continue the
game instead of ending it when the player retrieves the gold skull we’d
have defined something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">destination = camp</code>
on the pathBack object.</p>

<p>It so happens that whereas the earlier scheme of defining a method on
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">startroom.southeast</code> resembles the TADS 2 way
of doing things, this second scheme of pointing the southeast property
to a PathPassage object and then defining various methods of the
PathPassage closely resembles the adv3 way. The first way is often more
convenient, and that’s why adv3Lite allows it, but the second way is
more robust when you need something like a PathPassage or a StairwayUp
to represent a physical connection between locations. The more abstract
TravelConnector class, when not used to represent a physical object, can
also be useful in controlling conditional travel (through its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canTravelerPass()</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">explainTravelBarrier()</code> methods) or carrying
out the side-effects of travel (through its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">traveLDesc</code> method). We shall meet more
examples of this in due course.</p>
