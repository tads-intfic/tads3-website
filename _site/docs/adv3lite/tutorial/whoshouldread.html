<h1 id="who-should-read-this-book">Who Should Read This Book?</h1>

<p>Well, of course anyone’s welcome to read this book, and anyone curious
about systems for authoring Interactive Fiction may wish to do so, but
this tutorial has nevertheless been written with a particular target
audience in mind, namely people who want to learn how to write
Interactive Fiction using the adv3Lite library. Even then, it may suit
some people better than others. If you’re already familiar with TADS 2,
or with TADS 3 and adv3, or with another IF authoring system such as
Inform, or if you come from a reasonably competent programming
background, you may find you can get up to speed faster by reading the
adv3Lite Manual. The target reader of this tutorial is assumed to be
someone with little or no prior knowledge of authoring Interactive
Fiction with a system that’s broadly similar to a traditional
programming language.</p>

<p>The tutorial walks you through the creation of two very simple games and
then a rather more elaborate one, pointing out some of the key features
of the TADS 3 language and adv3Lite library along the way. It does not
aim to cover every aspect either of the language or of the adv3Lite
library, but it does aim to take you to the point where you can start
using the system on your own and find out what else you need to know by
consulting the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em> and the <a href="../manual/index.html">adv3Lite Library
Manual</a>. The target reader of this tutorial is thus
someone who is prepared to work through the sample games step-by-step,
typing out the code and trying it out, picking up the basic essentials
of the system as they go along. If you don’t have the patience for that,
or you don’t like the sound of that approach, this book may not be for
you. If, on the other hand, you’re keen to start trying things out but
need some guidance, and you’d appreciate a bit of hand-holding through
the initial stages then this may be just the tutorial you need.</p>

<p>One further point: it may not make me popular to say so, but the truth
is that some people get unstuck and then become frustrated with writing
IF with any system because they insist on trying to run before they have
properly learned to walk. Although it should be a lot easier to learn to
use adv3Lite than adv3, you will still need the patience to master the
basics before you can do anything very useful on your own, so if you
don’t have much prior programming experience or much experience with
another IF authoring system, and you are starting more or less from the
beginning, you’d probably be well advised to follow this tutorial if
you’re planning to work with adv3Lite. You may want to get started on
your epic adventure right away, and you may feel impatient at following
through the creation of some simple games that don’t match your grand
plans, but the time spent on following this tutorial could well save you
time in the long run, since it will help you master the basic skills you
need to set out creating your own epic. You wouldn’t try to write an
epic poem in classical Greek hexameters without first mastering the
Greek alphabet; it’s probably just as unwise to attempt to write an epic
piece of Interactive Fiction without mastering the basics of whatever
authoring system you want to use!</p>

<p>Of course, it may be that you don’t feel you’re a complete beginner but
you still feel you’d like some help. In which case you might like to
skim through the first few chapters of this book and only start
following it closely, say, when you reach Chapter 7 and we start working
on a more advanced game. That’s entirely up to you. In the next section
I’ll say a little more about the various ways you can use this book.</p>
