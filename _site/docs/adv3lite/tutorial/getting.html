<h1 id="getting-what-you-need">Getting What You Need</h1>

<p>The first thing you need is the latest version of the TADS 3 authoring
system. To use adv3Lite you need TADS 3.1.2 (or higher). If you have an
earlier version of TADS 3 than version 3.1.2 please update to the latest
version of TADS 3 now, before attempting to do anything else suggested
in this book.</p>

<p>For a Windows system, you want the Windows authoring kit that comes with
Windows Workbench. For Mac O/S X or Linux/Unix the recommended TADS
authoring system is FrobTADS. Both of these can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.tads.org/tads3.html">http://www.tads.org/tads3.html</a>. Even if you don’t have a Windows
system, however, you might want to consider trying to run Windows
Workbench under WINE, Parallels or Crossover (see, for example, the
discussion about this on
<a href="http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=6323">int-fiction.org</a>),
since using Workbench gives you an integrated development environment
(IDE) that makes many TADS 3 authoring tasks a whole lot easier,
although I understand that running Workbench on a non-Windows system
like this can be problematic. If you’re using a non-Windows system and
you don’t want to use Workbench (or you can’t get it to work) you’ll
also need to download a text editor for writing your code; Jim Aikin
recommends TextWrangler for MacOS (it’s free).</p>

<p>The other thing you’ll need (obviously) is the adv3Lite library. The
fact that you’re reading this probably means that you’ve obtained a copy
of it already, but in case you haven’t (maybe you’re reading this
on-line or on someone else’s machine), you can obtain the latest version
either from
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/58348218/adv3Lite/adv3Lite14.zip">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/58348218/adv3Lite/adv3Lite13.zip</a>
or from the
<a href="http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXprogrammingXtads3XlibraryXcontributions.html">IF-Archive</a>.</p>

<p>The adv3Lite library comes in a zip archive containing an adv3Lite
folder/directory and a number of subfolders. A good place to unzip this
into is the extensions folder/directory under the folder/directory in
which you keep, or plan to keep, your TADS 3 game source code. On a
Windows system this will typically be under My Documents\TADS 3; the
TADS 3 author’s kit setup program should create both this folder and the
extensions folder under it. On a non-Windows system you may need to
create these directories manually yourself.</p>

<p>You should therefore end up with all the adv3Lite material in a folder
somewhere like …\My Documents\extensions\adv3Lite (where … is the
path to your My Documents folder or its equivalent on a non-Windows
system). If you need to reinstall adv3Lite (for example, because you
want to update to a newer version) I recommend that you first delete the
existing extensions\adv3Lite folder/directory before unzipping the new
adv3Lite folder to the same location; this should avoid any problems
that might arise from remnants of an older version interfering with the
newer version.</p>
