<h1 id="weightier-matters">Weightier Matters</h1>

<h2 id="weighing-it-up">Weighing it up</h2>

<p>In the code used to decide whether or not to spring the trap when the
player character takes the skull from the pedestal, we simply counted
the number of items on the pedestal. This is fine in this game when
there’s only two portable objects in any case, but if this puzzle were
part of a rather larger game with rather more portable objects in it, it
might not be the best way to do things.</p>

<p>To illustrate the problem, try adding another small object to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cave</code> location:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + pebble: Thing 'tiny pebble; smooth round'
        "It's just a tiny, round pebble, almost perfectly smooth. "
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now compile and run the game again. You’ll find that putting the tiny
pebble on the pedestal works just as well in avoiding the trap as using
the more substantial rock, but that doesn’t seem to be right. Presumably
the springing of the trap is in some way related to the weight resting
on the pedestal, and while the rock might plausibly weigh the same as
the skull, the pebble must be a <em>lot</em> lighter. Of course we could change
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notifyRemove()</code> method on the pedestal to
check precisely which objects are on the pedestal when the rock or the
skull is about to be removed, but that’s rather an ad hoc solution, and
the more objects there are in the game, the more complex and messy and
ad hoc it will become, and the more chances there are of it not working
properly. In principle the player should be able to use any combination
of objects that weigh as much as or more than the skull and it should
work to avoid springing the trap.</p>

<p>The best way to produce a fully general solution, then, is to have the
springing of the trap dependent on the total weight of all the items
resting on the pedestal. The adv3Lite library doesn’t keep track of
weight by default, but it’s easy enough to modify Thing so it does.
Here’s a first attempt (which you could add right at the end of your
existing code):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify Thing
        weight = 1
        
        getWeightWithin()
        {
            local totalWeight = 0;
            for (local item in contents)
                totalWeight += item.weight;
            
            return totalWeight;
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This adds a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weight</code> property to the Thing
class and defines the default weight of every object as 1 (the unit can
be whatever you imagine it to be, absolute precision isn’t required here
in any case; what we’re really interested in is the rough relative
weights of different objects within the limitations of integer
arithmetic). For the sake of this exercise we’ll leave the weight of the
pebble as 1 (which it now inherits from the modified Thing, so we don’t
need to state it explicitly) and make the weight of both the rock and
the skull 10. (Note: adv3Lite in fact comes with a
<a href="../../extensions/docs/weight.html">Weight</a> extension which we could use
to implement this, but it will be more instructive for the sake of this
tutorial to do it from scratch; besides adv3Lite extensions are beyond
the scope of this tutorial).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ++ goldSkull: Thing 'gold skull;; head'
        "It's the shape and size of a human skull, but made of solid gold; it must
        be worth a fortune. "
        
        weight = 10
    ;

    + smallRock: Thing 'small rock; round solid'
         "It's roughly round and looks pretty solid. "
        
        weight = 10
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next step is to arrange for the trap to be sprung when the total
weight of objects resting on the pedestal is less than the weight of the
skull:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + pedestal: Fixture, Surface 'stone pedestal; smooth'
        "The smooth stone pedestal is artfully positioned to catch the sunlight at
        just this time of day. "
            
        notifyRemove(obj)
        {
            gMessageParams(obj);
            
            if(getWeightWithin() - obj.weight &lt; goldSkull.weight)
            {
                "As {the subj obj} {leaves} the pedestal, a volley of poisonous
                arrows is shot from the walls! You try to dodge the arrows, but
                they take you by surprise!";  
                
                finishGameMsg(ftDeath, [finishOptionUndo]);  
            }
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how we specify this. The total weight of objects resting on top of
the pedestal just before <em>obj</em> is removed is given by the new
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getWeightWithin()</code> method we just defined on
the modified Thing class. So the weight remaining on the pedestal after
obj (i.e. the object that’s being removed) is removed, is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getWeightWithin() - obj.weight</code>. The trap is
sprung if this is less than the weight of the gold skull. Note that we
haven’t specified any numbers here (such as 10); we’ve kept the code as
general as we can so that if, for example, we later changed our mind
about the weight of the skull and decided it should be 20, everything
would still work in a logical manner.</p>

<p>Another point to note is the introduction of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gMessageParams(obj)</code> construct, and the subtle
change of the start of the double-quoted string to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"As {the subj obj} {leaves} the pedestal..."</code>
These two changes very much go together: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{the subj
obj}</code> is a <em>message parameter substitution</em>, something we’ll be
seeing quite a bit of later. What this means is that when the game sees
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{the subj obj}</code> (the message parameter) it
<em>substitutes</em> the name of the object <em>obj</em> that is being removed (so
this does much the same as the previous
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;obj.theName\&gt;\&gt;</code> that it replaces). So
what’s the point of it? You’ll note that it’s now followed by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{leaves}</code> rather than
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leaves</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subj</code> in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{the subj obj}</code> tells the game that <em>obj</em> is
the subject of the verb that follows. By marking leaves as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{leaves}</code> we indicate that this is the verb
which has to agree with obj. This means that if obj were something with
a plural name, ‘the rocks’, say, the game would output “As the rocks
leave the pedestal” rather than “As the rocks leaves the pedestal”, but
if it’s singular, ‘the rock’, say, we get “As the rock leaves the
pedestal.” This kind of subject-verb agreement is hard to achieve using
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;\&lt;obj.theName\&gt;\&gt; </code>method but easy to
achieve using message parameter substitution.</p>

<p>To make it work, we have to identify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj</code> as a
<em>parameter name</em> as well as a <em>variable name</em>. That is what
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gMessageParams(obj)</code> does for us: it tells the
game, “treat <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj</code> as a parameter that refers to
the same object that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj</code> variable does”.
At first this may seem very arcane, since, after all,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj</code> appear
identical! But in fact they are different things in different contexts.
In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notifyRemove(obj)</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj.weight</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj</code> is a
variable name referencing an object; in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{the subj
obj}</code> obj is simply a piece of text within a string. The
difference is really that between obj (a variable name) and ‘obj’ (a
piece of text). We need the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gMessageParams(obj)</code> statement to make the
program recognize that the string ‘obj’ refers to the variable
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">obj</code> in the special context of a message
parameter substitution like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{the subj obj}</code>
within a string.</p>

<p>Don’t worry if this isn’t all entirely clear yet, as we’ll be coming
back to message parameter substitutions, and they’ll make more sense as
you get used to them. One last point to note about them right now,
though, is that putting braces round a verb like {leaves} doesn’t work
for all verbs, but only those irregular verbs the library knows about
(which is more about two hundred of the common ones). It is possible for
your game to define additional verbs that can be understood in message
parameter substitutions, but that’s not a subject for now.</p>

<p>We’re still not done yet, however, since there is a logical error in the
way we’ve defined the getWeightWithin() method, as you may have already
spotted. To demonstrate what it is, we’ll introduce another object into
the game, a knapsack worn by the player character. We can define it like
this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ++ knapsack: Wearable, Container 'knapsack; trusty old worn; bag sack'
        "Your trusty old knapsack may be getting a bit worn, but it's accompanied
        you on so many adventures you wouldn't be without it. "
        
        wornBy = me
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could have defined the knapsack as a Thing with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isWearable = true</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contType = In</code>, but we’re sticking to our
decision to use the library classes for this kind of thing. Here
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wearable</code> contributes
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isWearable = true</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Container</code> contributes
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contType = In</code>. We still have to supply
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wornBy = me</code>, however, since a Wearable object
isn’t necessarily worn; it might also be carried. In his case we want it
to start out worn by the player character, so we set
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wornBy = me</code>. We also need to ensure that the
definition of the knapsack object follows directly after the definition
of the me object in our code, so that the knapsack forms part of the
player character’s contents.</p>

<p>Try recompiling the game and playing it with the knapsack added. Go into
the cave, put the rock into the knapsack, and then put the knapsack onto
the pedestal. Now take the gold skull. You’ll find the trap is still
sprung, even though the knapsack with the rock in it ought to weigh
enough to have prevented it. You’ve probably already worked out what the
problem is: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getWeightWithin()</code> calculates the
total weight of an object’s contents by adding up the weights of each
item in its contents list — ignoring any further items they may happen
to contain in turn. What it should do is to add up the weight of every
items in its contents, plus the weight of the items <em>they</em> contain, and
so on all the way down the chain, plus the weight of the original
object. Just a couple of small changes should fix it:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify Thing
        weight = 1
        
        getWeightWithin()
        {
            local totalWeight = 0;
            for (local item in contents)
                totalWeight += item.getWeight;
            
            return totalWeight;
        }
        
        getWeight = weight + getWeightWithin()
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At first sight this may look a little odd, since
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getWeightWithin()</code> now calls itself as part of
its calculation. In fact this <em>recursion</em>, as its called, is a perfectly
legal and often useful programming technique, provided it’s handled with
care. For example, if there was any danger that getWeightWithin() might
call itself on the same object that was doing the calling (for example,
that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">knapsack.getWeightWithin()</code> might call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">knapsack.getWeightWithin()</code>) then we would
indeed be in trouble, for our code could then get itself into an
infinite loop from which it would never emerge and our game would hang.
The golden rule of recursion is to ensure that there’s always some way
to end it, but here we’re safe since each recursive call goes a step
down the containment tree, and however far the containment tree goes, it
can never be infinite (unless we’ve done something <em>really</em> weird in our
game code) so we can be sure it’ll bottom out somewhere (specifically,
when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getWeightWithin()</code> is called on an item
like the rock that has no contents, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code>
loop has nothing to do, so there’s no further recursion). Note that
we’ve also added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getWeight</code> property, which
is the total weight of a Thing (the weight of the object itself plus the
weight of everything that it contains) and that we’ve defined this
property as an expression, which is perfectly legal in TADS 3.</p>

<p>By the same token we need to ensure that the weight of any item we
remove from the pedestal includes the weight of its contents, so we want
to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getWeight</code> property of the object
being removed rather than just its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weight</code>
property:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + pedestal: Fixture, Surface 'stone pedestal; smooth'
        "The smooth stone pedestal is artfully positioned to catch the sunlight at
        just this time of day. "
            
        notifyRemove(obj)
        {
            gMessageParams(obj);
            
            if(getWeightWithin() - obj.getWeight &lt; goldSkull.weight)
            {
                "As {the subj obj} {leaves} the pedestal, a volley of poisonous
                arrows is shot from the walls! You try to dodge the arrows, but
                they take you by surprise!";  
                
                finishGameMsg(ftDeath, [finishOptionUndo]);  
            }
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you compile and run the game again, you should find it runs as
expected.</p>

<h2 id="throwing-stones">Throwing Stones</h2>

<p>Although we’ve designed the game so that the way to get the gold skull
is to place the rock on the pedestal first, that’s not the only solution
that might occur to the player. Another way to use the rock might be to
throw it at the skull to knock it off the pedestal while the player
character stands far enough away to avoid the volley of deadly arrows.
Whether or not we allow this solution, a well-designed game ought to
anticipate the attempt and provide an appropriate response. The
library’s default response to throwing something at something else is to
have the missile strike the target and fall to the ground without
affecting anything else. That’s probably an appropriate response to the
player throwing the pebble at the skull, but if the rock is thrown at
the skull, it really should dislodge it from the pedestal. Let’s say
that the skull will be knocked off the pedestal if the object thrown at
it is at least half its weight, then if we want the rock-throwing
solution to succeed, we might write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ++ goldSkull: Thing 'gold skull;; head'
        "It's the shape and size of a human skull, but made of solid gold; it must
        be worth a fortune. "
        
        weight = 10
        
        iobjFor(ThrowAt)
        {
            action()
            {
                if(location != pedestal || gDobj.getWeight() &lt; weight / 2)
                    inherited;
                else
                {
                    moveInto(cave);
                    gDobj.moveInto(cave);
                    "{The subj dobj} {strikes} the gold skull, sending both objects
                    tumbling to the floor. At the same time, a volley of poisonous
                    arrows is shot from the walls! Fortunately you're standing just
                    far enough away to avoid being hit. ";
                }
            }
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If, on the other hand, we don’t want this solution to work (perhaps the
cave isn’t big enough to allow the player character to stand far enough
away to avoid the trap), we can use the slightly simpler:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ++ goldSkull: Thing 'gold skull;; head'
        "It's the shape and size of a human skull, but made of solid gold; it must
        be worth a fortune. "
        
        weight = 10
        
        iobjFor(ThrowAt)
        {
            action()
            {
                inherited;
                if(gDobj.getWeight() &gt;= weight/2 &amp;&amp; location == pedestal)
                    actionMoveInto(cave);
            }
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, so let’s take a closer look at what’s going on here. The command
THROW ROCK AT SKULL consists of a verb (throw), two nouns (rock and
skull) and a preposition (at). This kind of action is said to have two
<em>objects</em>, the <em>direct object</em>, coming between the verb and the
preposition (in this case the rock) and the <em>indirect object</em>
immediately following the preposition (in this case the gold skull).
When we write a section of code that starts
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iobjFor(ThrowAt)</code> we’re defining what happens
to this object (in this case the gold skull) when it’s the <em>indirect
object</em> of a ThrowAt action (or, in plainer English, the target of a
throw); remember, whenever you see ‘iobj’ think ‘indirect object’.</p>

<p>There are several stages in the action processing cycle at which the
gold skull could respond to being the target of a throw, but in the
interests of keeping things as simple as possible we shan’t go into them
all now. The stage we’re interested in is the action() stage, which
means that the action has passed all the tests that might rule it out
(for example trying to throw something that’s too heavy to pick up, or
throw something at a target that’s too far away) and is now going ahead.
In the action() part we simply define what the action does (in this
case, what happens when something hits the gold skull).</p>

<p>One thing we need to know in writing this action part is what’s just
been thrown at the gold skull, in other words what the direct object of
the ThrowAt command is. This is stored in the object property
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libGlobal.curAction.getDobj()</code>, but since
that’s rather a lot of typing for something so commonly needed, the
library lets us abbreviate it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj</code>.
(Technically, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj</code> is a macro masquerading as
a pseudo-global variable, but you really don’t need to worry about that
right now unless you were desperately anxious about what sort of thing
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj</code> could possibly be in a language that
doesn’t have any global variables). You could similarly use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gIobj</code> to get at the indirect object of the
command if you needed it (but here we know the indirect object must be
the gold skull, since that’s where we’re defining this
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iobjFor()</code> code).</p>

<p>Remember that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited</code> keyword means “at
this point do what the method we’re inheriting from would have done”; in
this context it thus means “carry out the default ThrowAt handling”
(which is to report that the missile has struck the target and landed on
the floor, and to move the missile to the enclosing room).</p>

<p>Armed with those pieces of information we’re now in a position to
examine how each version of the ThrowAt handling works. In the first
version above, which makes throwing the rock at the skull a successful
solution to the puzzle, we first check whether it’s the case either that
the skull isn’t on the pedestal any more, or that the missile being
thrown at it (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj</code>, the direct object of the
command) is less than half the weight of the skull (since this is being
defined on the goldSkull object, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weight</code>
unqualified by any other object name refers to the weight of the skull).
If either of these two conditions is met (the skull is no longer on the
pedestal or the missile being thrown at it is too light to dislodge it),
we carry out the inherited handling (the missile strikes the skull and
falls to the ground). Otherwise (if the missile is heavy enough and the
skull is on the pedestal), we move both the skull and the missile to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cave</code> room (representing the fact that they
both end up on the floor) and report what happens. Note the use of the
message parameter substitutions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"{The subj dobj}
{strikes}"</code> at the begining of this report. If it’s the rock
that’s thrown this becomes “The small rock strikes” before it’s
displayed to the player, but because it’s been written with message
parameter substitutions it will name the correct object whatever the
player throws at the skull.</p>

<p>You may be wondering about the difference between
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{The subj
dobj}</code>, both of which have been used to refer to the direct object
of this command in this short piece of code. The difference is that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{The subj dobj}</code> simply produces some text, the
name of the direct object, and marks it as the subject of the verb
that’s about to follow (that’s what the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subj</code>
part is for), while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj</code> provides a reference
to the object itself. We need to move the object to the floor, not it’s
name; conversely we need to display the object’s name, not the object.
More concretely, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj</code> refers to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smallRock</code> object while
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"{The subj dobj}"</code> expands into the string ‘The
small rock’.</p>

<p>The second example, where we don’t allow throwing the rock as a
successful solution to the puzzle, is a bit simpler. We start by
carrying out the inherited handling in any case, since whatever happens
we want to report the missile striking the gold skull and then falling
to the floor. Then, if it’s the case that the skull is on the pedestal
and the missile (i.e. the direct object) is at least half the weight of
the skull, we move the goldSkull object to the cave (here representing
the floor of the cave). Since we here do so using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actionMoveInto(cave)</code> rather than just
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moveInto(cave)</code> as we did in the first version,
the removal of the skull from the pedestal will trigger the pedestal’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notifyRemove(obj)</code> method which, you may
recall, reports the launching of the poison arrows and the death of the
player character. Conversely, we used
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moveInto()</code> rather than
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actionMoveInto()</code> in the first version to avoid
precisely this happening.</p>

<p>Don’t worry if you’re thinking there’s rather a lot to take in here, or
you’re wondering how the heck you’d ever be able to work all this out
for yourself. If it’s all new to you it’s bound to seem a bit odd and
confusing at first. As you work through this tutorial this kind of thing
should gradually become more familiar to you and you’ll gradually gain
