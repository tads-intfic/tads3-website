<h1 id="ask-tell-give-show">Ask, Tell, Give, Show</h1>

<h2 id="introduction-and-overview">Introduction and Overview</h2>

<p>At its simplest, adv3Lite implements a basic ask/tell conversation
system. This is so-called because it allows NPCs to respond to
conversational commands of the form ASK BOB ABOUT LIGHTHOUSE or TELL
MARTHA ABOUT BOB, as well as ASK BOB FOR MONEY or GIVE THE COIN TO BOB
or SHOW THE TICKET TO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT.</p>

<p>In adv3Lite, the responses to commands of this sort can be defined using
TopicEntries, just like the ConsultTopics we used when constructing the
computer in the <a href="security.html#consult">Security Centre</a>. There are
various kinds of TopicEntry corresponding to the various kinds of
conversational commands we have just listed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AskTopic</strong> responds to ASK X ABOUT Y</li>
  <li><strong>TellTopic</strong> responds to TELL X ABOUT Y</li>
  <li><strong>AskTellTopic</strong> responds to ASK X ABOUT Y or TELL X ABOUT Y</li>
  <li><strong>AskForTopic</strong> responds to ASK X FOR Y</li>
  <li><strong>GiveTopic</strong> responds to GIVE Y TO X (or equivalently, GIVE X Y, e.g.
GIVE BOB THE COIN)</li>
  <li><strong>ShowTopic</strong> responds to SHOW Y TO X (or equivalently, SHOW X Y, e.g.
SHOW BOB THE COIN)</li>
  <li><strong>GiveShowTopic</strong> responds to GIVE Y TO X or SHOW Y TO X</li>
</ul>

<p>In all the above, X is the person being addressed. For Give or Show Y
must be a physical game object in scope that is to be given or shown to
X. For all the rest Y is a topic, which may be any game object the
player character knows about or any abstract topic defined in the game,
like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tFrenchRevolution</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tFlightDepartures</code> topics we defined for the
security centre <a href="security.html#consult">computer</a>.</p>

<p>Note also that once a conversation with a particular NPC is underway,
the player can enter abbreviated forms of all the above commands without
having to name the NPC again, such as ASK ABOUT Y or just A Y, T Y (for
TELL X ABOUT Y), ASK FOR Y, SHOW Y and GIVE Y. These abbreviated
conversational commands still trigger the same kinds of TopicEntry.</p>

<p>To associate a conversational TopicEntry with a particular NPC we can
put it in one of two places: either directly located within the NPC
(generally using the + syntax to indicate its location), or located
within one of the NPC’s ActorStates. Any TopicEntries placed in an
ActorState will only be triggered while the NPC is in that state; this
enables us to customize an NPC’s responses according to the state it’s
in, if we so wish. TopicEntries in an Actor’s current state take
precedence over any defined directly in the Actor (if they would match
the same topic/object), but TopicEntries placed directly in the Actor
can be used to provide responses that are independent of ActorState (or,
of course, for NPCs that don’t have different states). This should all
become clearer once we start working through some examples.</p>

<p>Obviously we can’t anticipate every conversational command a player
might try. There may be reasonable ones we miss, like ASK ATTENDANT
ABOUT REFRESHMENTS or unreasonable ones like ASK ATTENDANT ABOUT HER
MOTHER’S LAST HOLIDAY, but either way we need our NPCs to be able to
respond in a way that effectively tells the player “I am not programmed
to respond in this area” while sounding a bit more believably human. For
this purpose we can define one or more catch-all DefaultTopics, that
will provide a response to something we hadn’t specifically allowed for.
The principal kinds of DefaultTopic commonly used are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DefaultAskTopic</strong> responds to ASK X ABOUT Y</li>
  <li><strong>DefaultTellTopic</strong> responds to TELL X ABOUT Y</li>
  <li><strong>DefaultAskTellTopic</strong> responds to ASK X ABOUT Y or TELL X ABOUT Y</li>
  <li><strong>DefaultAskForTopic</strong> responds to ASK X FOR Y</li>
  <li><strong>DefaultGiveTopic</strong> responds to GIVE Y TO X (or equivalently, GIVE X
Y, e.g. GIVE BOB THE COIN)</li>
  <li><strong>DefaultShowTopic</strong> responds to SHOW Y TO X (or equivalently, SHOW X
Y, e.g. SHOW BOB THE COIN)</li>
  <li><strong>DefaultGiveShowTopic</strong> responds to GIVE Y TO X or SHOW Y TO X</li>
  <li><strong>DefaultAnyTopic</strong> responds to any conversational command for which
we have not provided a more specific response.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that there is an order of precedence among DefaultTopics, the more
specific taking precedence over the less specific. Thus, for example, if
you define a DefaultAnyTopic, a DefaultAskTellTopic, and a
DefaultAskTopic for the same actor, the DefaultAskTopic will respond to
ASK X ABOUT Y, the DefaultAskTellTopic will respond to TELL X ABOUT Y,
and the DefaultAnyTopic to anything else (such as ASK X FOR Y or SHOW Y
TO X).</p>

<p>The above list of TopicEntry and DefaultTopic types is not exhaustive.
For the complete list consult the
<a href="../manual/actortopicentry.html#types">ActorTopicEntry</a> section of the
<em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>. But the list shown above is sufficient for
now; we’ll come to some of the other types in later sections when we
discuss various ways in which adv3Lite can go beyond the basic ask/tell
system. For the remainder of this section we’ll illustrate some examples
of basic ask/tell by making some of the characters in our airport a bit
more talkative.</p>

<h2 id="not-talking-to-pablo-cortez">Not Talking to Pablo Cortez</h2>

<p>We don’t actually want our protagonist to talk to Pablo Cortez at all,
since the idea is to avoid attracting Cortez’s attention. In this case
all we need is a single DefaultAnyTopic that explains this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + DefaultAnyTopic
        "You really don't want to attract his attention. If he recognizes you he'll
        kill you. "
        
        isConversational = nil
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This object definition should be placed somewhere after the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cortez</code> object in the npcs.t file so that the +
sign locates it in cortez.</p>

<p>We define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isConversational = nil</code> on this
DefaultAnyTopic because no conversation actually takes place (and so we
don’t want Cortez marked as the player character’s current
interlocutor).</p>

<p>And that’s really all we have to do to complete our implementation of
Pablo Cortez.</p>

<h2 id="limited-conversation-with-the-security-guard">Limited Conversation with the Security Guard</h2>

<p>The Security Guard is not a major NPC in our game, but there are one or
two things the player character could reasonably try to talk with him
about. One obvious topic of conversation, since the player character is
anxious to find a plane leaving the airport, would be flight departures,
for which we’ve already defined a corresponding
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tFlightDepartures</code> Topic object. As a first
attempt, then, we might define an AskTopic for our Security Guard thus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + AskTopic @tFlightDepartures
       "&lt;q&gt;When's the next plane out of here?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
       &lt;q&gt;Listen for the announcements, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; he suggests, &lt;q&gt;or look at
       the departure boards through there.&lt;/q&gt; He jerks his thumb vaguely in the
       direction of north. "
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we use the @ symbol in the TopicEntry template to denote the fact
that we’re defining the AskTopic’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">matchObj</code>
property, namely the Topic (or Thing) that we want this AskTopic to
match. We have also used the ñ HTML entity to provide the ñ in
Señor.</p>

<p>This AskTopic will do the job well enough, but it will make the security
guard seem a bit robotic, since he’ll give precisely the same answer
every time the player character asks him about flight departures. We can
alleviate this a little by using a StopEventList on the AskTopic to vary
the response. A StopEventList runs through each item in its list in turn
and then keeps repeating the last one. To use one with a TopicEntry we
simply add StopEventList to the class list and then supply a list of
single-quoted strings in place of the double-quoted string giving the
response:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + AskTopic, StopEventList @tFlightDepartures
        [
            '&lt;q&gt;When\'s the next plane out of here?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
            &lt;q&gt;Listen for the announcements, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; he suggests, &lt;q&gt;or
            look at the departure boards through there.&lt;/q&gt; He jerks his thumb
            vaguely in the direction of north. ',
            
            '&lt;q&gt;Is there a flight leaving soon?&lt;/q&gt; you enquire.\b
            &lt;q&gt;I already told you, Se&amp;ntilde;or: listen for the announcements or
            watch the board,&lt;/q&gt; he replies with a faint air of impatience.'
        ]
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since this man is presumably meant to have something to do with airport
security, it’s possible that the player character might try to tell him
about Pablo Cortez’s takeover of the plane, which we can do in a similar
fashion via a TellTopic:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + TellTopic, StopEventList @cortez
        [
            '&lt;q&gt;A criminal called Pablo Cortez has just tried to take over the
            flight to Buenos Aires,&lt;/q&gt; you say.\b
            &lt;q&gt;I am sure it will all be taken care of, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; the guard
            assures you nonchalantly. ',
            
            '&lt;q&gt;Pablo Cortez...&lt;/q&gt; you begin.\b
            The guard cuts you off with a gesture of his hand. &lt;q&gt;All taken care
            of, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; he insists. '
        ]
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you try compiling and running the game at this point, you’ll find
that this TellTopic won’t be triggered unless and until the player
character has actually seen Cortez, which in this case is what we want.
But how does this come about? The answer is that a TopicEntry won’t
match a game object (like cortez) unless the player character knows
about it, and unless we arrange things otherwise, the player character
only comes to know about things when he’s seen them. This wasn’t an
issue with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tFlightDepartures</code> topic,
precisely because it’s a Topic, and the library’s default assumption is
that all Topics start out known to the player character. If we had
wanted the player character to start out knowing about Cortez, we could
have included <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">familiar = true</code> on the
definition of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cortez</code> object, or we could
have called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gSetKnown(cortez)</code> at some
convenient point in the game; but here it suits us to treat Cortez as
unknown until the player character sees him.</p>

<p>Something else the player character might obviously try to do in
conversation with the security guard is to ask for the ID card back once
it’s been confiscated. For that purpose we can use an AskForTopic:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + AskForTopic @IDcard
        "&lt;q&gt;Can I have my ID card back, please?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
        &lt;q&gt;That was not your ID card, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; the guard replies equably.
        &lt;q&gt;I know Antonio Velaquez, and you are not he.&lt;/q&gt; "
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is that this AskForTopic can be triggered once the player
has seen the ID card; there’s no guarantee that it will have been
confiscated. We therefore need to place some kind of condition on when
this AskForTopic is active. We can do that by defining its isActive
property. The next question is what condition to place on it. When the
ID card has been confiscated it’s returned to its initial position on
the counter, but that’s not enough by itself, since if we just defined
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isActive = (IDCard.location == counter)</code>, the
AskForTopic could be triggered if the player character had simply seen
the card and left it in place. We need to know additionally that the
Security Guard has actually confiscated the card.</p>

<p>We can do this by using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;.reveal\&gt;</code> tag in
the message announcing the confiscation of the card, and then testing
for the output of that tag with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gRevealed()</code>.
We can used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;.reveal *key*\&gt;</code> whenever we want
to represent the revelation of some fact to the player character. Here
<em>key</em> is just an arbitrary piece of text we use to represent the fact in
question. Here, for example, we could use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">card-confiscated</code>.</p>

<p>First, then, we must add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;.reveal\&gt;</code> tag to
the notice of the card’s confiscation; this occurs on the definition of
the metal detector:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + metalDetector: Passage 'metal detector; crude; frame'
        "The metal detector is little more than a crude metal frame, just large
        enough to step through, with a power cable trailing across the floor. "
        destination = concourse
        
        isOn = (powerSwitch.isOn == true)
        
        canTravelerPass(traveler)
        {
            return !isOn || !IDcard.isIn(traveler);
        }
        
        explainTravelBarrier(traveler)
        {
            "The metal detector buzzes furiously as you pass through it. The
            security guard beckons you back immediately, with a pointed
            tap of his holstered pistol. After a brisk search, he discovers the ID
            card and takes it off you with a disapproving shake of his head,
            before handing it to a colleague who walks off with it. &lt;.reveal
            card-confiscated&gt; ";
            
            IDcard.moveInto(counter);
        }
        
        travelDesc()
        {
            "You pass through the metal detector without incident. ";
            
            if(takeover.startedAt == nil)
                announcementObj.start();
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the same time as adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;.reveal
card-confiscated\&gt;</code> tag we’ve added a few words about a colleague
to explain how the card finds its way back to the counter.</p>

<p>The next step is to add the appropriate isActive condition to the
AskForTopic:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + AskForTopic @IDcard
        "&lt;q&gt;Can I have my ID card back, please?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
        &lt;q&gt;That was not your ID card, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; the guard replies equably.
        &lt;q&gt;I know Antonio Velaquez, and you are not he.&lt;/q&gt; "
        
        isActive = gRevealed('card-confiscated') &amp;&amp; IDcard.location == counter
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not absolutely bullet-proof, since the player character could
find the ID card on the counter after it has been confiscated and still
leave it there, which would make his request to the guard at least a bit
tongue-in-cheek, but it will probably do well enough.</p>

<p>One more thing the player might try is to show the card to the guard in
the hope that this will somehow facilitate his passage through the metal
detector. In that case the guard will presumably confiscate it, which
means we’ll need our ShowTopic to do a bit more than just display some
text. We can do that by defining its topicResponse property explicitly
as a method rather than as a double-quoted string via the template:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + ShowTopic @IDcard
        topicResponse()
        {
            "You flash the ID card at the security guard, in the hope that it'll
            persuade him to let you straight through without any further questions,
            but instead he snatches it off you, stares at it with a deep frown.\b
            &lt;q&gt;This is not yours, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; he remarks.\b
            So saying, he hands the card to a colleague who at once carries it off
            somewhere.&lt;.reveal card-confiscated&gt; ";
            
            IDcard.moveInto(counter);
        }    
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because of the way the ShowTo action is defined, a ShowTopic can’t be
triggered unless the object it’s meant to match is visible, so there’s
no danger that this one will be matched while the card is still on the
counter, say, but we might prefer it to be matched only if the player
character is actually carrying the card. We could do that with an
isActive condition on the ShowTopic, but a slightly neater solution is
to put an objHeld preCondition on the ShowTo response of the IDcard,
since this will trigger an implicit take if the player character drops
the card before showing it to the guard:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ++ IDcard: Key 'an ID Card; identification poor; photo'     
        "According to what's on the front it apparently belongs to one Antonio
        Velaquez. Fortunately the accompanying photo is so poor it could be of
        almost anyone, even you. A magnetic stripe runs down the back. "
        
        actualLockList = [securityDoor]
        plausibleLockList = [securityDoor]
        
        bulk = 1
        
        dobjFor(ShowTo)   {  preCond = [objHeld]   }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we should give the security guard some form of default response
to handle all other conversational commands. Since he’s not really a
major character we can afford to go with something fairly
unsophisticated:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + DefaultAnyTopic
        "The guard merely shrugs and mutters something that could be either, &lt;q&gt;Not
        my concern, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;Not your concern, Se&amp;ntilde;or.&lt;/q&gt; "
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="showing-the-ticket-to-the-flight-attendant">Showing the Ticket to the Flight Attendant</h2>

<p>You’ll recall that as a temporary expedient we put some code in the
angelaTicketAgenda AgendaItem so that the flight attendant would
automatically see if the player character was carrying a ticket, and
allow him to board if so. Now we know how to allow the player character
to show things to people, we can remove that code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + angelaTicketAgenda: ConvAgendaItem
        initiallyActive = true
        
        invokeItem()
        {
            isDone = true;
            "&lt;q&gt;Welcome aboard, sir,&lt;/q&gt; {the subj angela} greets you with a smile.
            &lt;q&gt;May I see your ticket please?&lt;/q&gt; ";
                      
    //        /* The code shown commented out below can be deleted */
    //        if(ticket.isDirectlyIn(me))
    //        {
    //            "She glances down at the ticket in your hand, and temporarily takes
    //            it off you to check it. &lt;q&gt;That's fine, sir,&lt;/q&gt; she assures you as
    //            she returns it to you. &lt;q&gt;Please move to the rear of the plane to
    //            find a seat.&lt;/q&gt; ";
    //            angelaGreetingState.ticketSeen = true;
    //        }        
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instead, we can put similar code in the topicResponse() method of a
GiveShowTopic, so that the player character can (and must) explicitly
show his ticket to the flight attendant. Since this is only relevant
when the flight attendant is in her
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">angelaGreetingState</code> state, it’s probably best
to locate our GiveShowTopic there rather than directly in angela:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ++ GiveShowTopic @ticket
        topicResponse()
        {
            "&lt;q&gt;Here you are,&lt;/q&gt; you say, holding out the ticket for {the angela}
            to see.\b
            She glances down at the ticket in your hand, and temporarily takes it
            off you to check. &lt;q&gt;That's fine, sir,&lt;/q&gt; she assures you as she
            returns it to you. &lt;q&gt;Please move to the rear of the plane to find a
            seat.&lt;/q&gt; ";
            
            angelaGreetingState.ticketSeen = true;
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve now completed all the conversation we want to implement with Pablo
Cortez and the Security Guard, but this is just the start of the
conversation we’ll implement for Angela. In the sections that follow
we’ll explore what adv3Lite has to offer beyond the basic ask/tell
paradigm we’ve illustrated here. In the meantime, for more information
about implementing basic ask/tell conversation in adv3Lite, see the
section on <a href="../manual/asktell.html">Basic Ask/Tell</a> in the <em>adv3Lite
Library Manual</em>, while for more on how knowledge of objects and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;.reveal\&gt;</code> tags can impact on conversation,
