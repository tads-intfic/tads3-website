<h1 id="the-security-guard--a-really-simple-npc">The Security Guard — A Really Simple NPC</h1>

<p>Back in Chapter 7 we arranged for the ID card to be confiscated by a
security guard if the player character attempts to pass through the
metal detector carrying the card, unless the metal detector is switched
off. We therefore clearly need an NPC to represent the security guard,
although the implementation can be very simple, since confiscating the
card is about the only role he will be called to play in the game. He’s
therefore a good choice for our first NPC.</p>

<p>The object that represents the actual physical presence of the NPC (as
opposed to various aspects of its behaviour) is defined much like any
other Thing, except that we define it to be of class Actor. The Actor
object representing the security guard might look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    guard: Actor 'security guard; burly flab; man; him' @securityGate
        "He's a burly-looking fellow, though it's probably as much flab as muscle. "
        
        actorSpecialDesc = "A security guard stands by the metal detector, eyeing
            you suspiciously. "
        
        checkAttackMsg = 'With your training you could probably overpower him
            easily enough, although he\'s armed and you\'re not, but that would
            probably result in all the other airport security staff coming after you,
            which is a complication you could do without right now. '
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can place this code right at the start of your npcs.t file, and then
recompile and run the game to ensure that the security guard is now
present by the security gate.</p>

<p>There are a few points to note about this definition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Since we’re defining the security guard in a separate file, we can’t
use the + notation to define his initial location. Instead we use
the @ notation as the second element in the template to define where
the security guard starts out, hence
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@securityGate</code>. This is a technique you’ll
often use when defining NPCs.</li>
  <li>Note that we use all four sections of the vocab property, ending it
with ‘him’ after the third and final semicolon. This defines the NPC
as being male (rather than female or neuter), so that he can be
referred to with the pronoun ‘him’, and so that any
library-generated messages will use the right pronoun to refer to
him.</li>
  <li>Note that we’ve used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actorSpecialDesc</code> to
provide a separate paragraph about the security guard in the room
listing. This works much like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">specialDesc</code>,
and indeed in this particular case we could have used
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">specialDesc</code> just as well, but with a more
complex actor this would have broken part of the ActorState
mechanism, so using <strong>actorSpecialDesc</strong> with Actors is a good habit
to get into. The reason for this will become more apparent when we
come to implement the flight attendant.</li>
  <li>We’ve also defined a <strong>checkAttackMsg</strong> to provide a customized
(refusal) response to HIT GUARD, ATTACK GUARD and the like, an
action which the player might well try. If this property is defined
it actually stops the ATTACK action at the check stage (typically as
here with a message explaining why the player character isn’t going
to carry out this action).</li>
</ol>

<p>For now, this really is all there is to defining the security guard. For
sure, as implemented he seems hardly more than another Decoration
object, but we’ll make him a bit more responsive in Chapter 11, when we
implement some NPC conversation.</p>
