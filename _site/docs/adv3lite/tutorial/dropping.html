<h1 id="dropping-objects-from-the-tree">Dropping objects from the tree</h1>

<p>Once Heidi reaches the top of the tree the player may encounter another
problem, or at least a point at which the behaviour of the game appears
to defy reality. If Heidi drops the bird or the nest while at the top of
the tree the object will appear to remain suspended in mid-air, as it
were. One solution might be to assume that anything dropped at the top
of the tree is put on the branch, and we could implement that. This
would be another good use of a Doer:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    Doer 'drop Thing'
        execAction(curCmd)    
        {        
            doInstead(PutOn, gDobj, branch);
        }
        
        where = topOfTree
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here ‘drop Thing’ will match the attempt to drop any Thing (in this
context either the bird or the nest, since these are the only two
portable objects in the game). The condition <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where =
topOfTree</code> ensures that this Doer only takes effect when the
player character is at the top of the tree; when she’s anywhere else we
want the DROP command to work as normal (incidentally we could supply a
list of rooms, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[topOfTree,
clearing\]</code>, here if we wanted our Doer to take effect in more
than one room). We then call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doInstead(PutOn, gDobj,
branch);</code> to turn the DROP <em>command</em> into a PutOn <em>action</em>. The
first parameter we must pass is the new action we want the player
character to carry out, in this case the PutOn action (the action that
would normally be triggered by a command of the form PUT X ON Y). We can
then specify the two objects we want the PutOn action to work with; here
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj</code> means the existing direct object of the
command.</p>

<p>With the PutOn action the <em>direct object</em> is the object being placed
(the bird or the nest) and the <em>indirect object</em> is the object on which
we want to place it (here the branch). In this instance the direct
object doesn’t change, since it will be the same as the direct object of
the original DROP command (if Heidi drops the nest, it’s the nest that
should be put on the branch, and if she drops the bird, it’s the bird
that needs to be put on the branch), so we can just specify it as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj</code> (the existing direct object). But we do
need to specify the particular new indirect object of the command (here
the branch), otherwise the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doInstead()</code> method
won’t know what to put the direct object on.</p>

<p>This is a perfectly good use of a Doer and a perfectly decent solution
to the problem of what should happen to objects dropped at the top of
the tree, but it’s not the solution employed in the <em>Inform Beginner’s
Guide</em>, from which Heidi has been borrowed. One reason for that might be
that it makes it a bit too easy for the player to win the game if DROP
NEST effectively turns into the winning move PUT NEST ON BRANCH. Another
might be that everywhere else in this game (and most others) DROP
SOMETHING results in something falling to the ground, not in something
being placed elsewhere. It could thus be argued that for the sake of
consistency that’s what should happen here: anything dropped at the top
of the tree should fall to the ground, the problem in this case being
that the ground is in the clearing at the bottom of the tree.</p>

<p>We therefore need to find some way of intercepting the DROP command to
make objects dropped at the top of the tree fall to the clearing below.
We could use a Doer to do this, but here we’ll illustrate another way,
using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomBeforeAction()</code> method of the
location to intercept an action just before it takes place:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    topOfTree: Room 'At the top of the tree'
        "You cling precariously to the trunk. "
        
        down = clearing
        
        cannotGoThatWay(dir)
        {
            "The only way from here is down. ";
        }
        
        roomBeforeAction()
        {
            if(gActionIs(Drop))
            {
                gDobj.actionMoveInto(clearing);
                "{The subj dobj} {falls} to the ground below. ";
                exit;
            }
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s explain how this works. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomBeforeAction()</code> method is called on the
player character’s current location just before she’s about to carry out
an action. The test <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if(gActionIs(Drop))</code> checks
whether the current action is a Drop action; if it is, the statements in
braces immediately following the if-statement are executed (while if it
isn’t, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">roomBeforeAction()</code> method simply
finishes its work without doing anything else). The statement
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj.actionMoveInto(clearing);</code> moves the
direct object of the Drop command (either the bird or the nest) into the
clearing; note the use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gDobj </code>to get at the
direct object of the current action. We could have just used
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moveInto(clearing)</code> here, but using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actionMoveInto()</code> is a good habit to get into
in this kind of situation, to ensure that the appropriate notifications
are triggered (yes I know I keep on mentioning ‘notifications’ without
explaining what I mean, but there’s a limit to how many things I can
explain at once without confusing you, and this one will just have to
wait till a more opportune time; but if you really want to know about
them now you could look at the section on <a href="../manual/react.html">Reacting to
Actions</a> in the adv3Lite manual).</p>

<p>The next statement, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"{The subj dobj} {falls} to the
ground below. ";</code>, tells the player what’s just happened. Since we
don’t know what object Heidi will drop (in this game it can only be the
bird or the nest, but in a bigger game it could be one of a large number
of things) we need to write this message in such a way that it will
accurately refer to the dropped object whatever it is. We do this with
the <em>message substitution parameter</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{The subj
dobj}</code> which means “the direct object of the command, taken as the
subject of the verb that follows”. The “The” at the beginning tells the
game to use the definite article (if appropriate; it would not be with
proper names) with the first letter capitalized (appropriately for the
start of the sentence). The next token,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{falls}</code>, tells the game to use the correct
form of the verb ‘to fall’ to agree with the subject. We could just have
written ‘falls’ here (without the curly braces), since in this game the
subject of the sentence can only be the bird or the nest, so we know
it’ll always be singular. In a bigger game that might not always be the
case, however. If Heidi was also carrying some nuts, and dropped them
from the top of the tree you’d want the player to see “The nuts <strong>fall</strong>
to the ground below” not “The nuts <strong>falls</strong> to the ground below”, and
by placing ‘falls’ in curly braces we ensure that that’s what you’d get.
Note, however, that this only works for verbs the library knows about,
which is most of the common irregular ones. For a regular verb we’d just
place the ending in curly braces according to how the ending should
change. For example, if you had written <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"{The subj
dobj} {plummets} to the ground below. ";</code> it wouldn’t have worked,
because ‘plummet’ isn’t an irregular verb; instead you’d need to write
“{The subj dobj} plummet{s/?ed} to the ground below. “;.</p>

<p>A <em>message substitution parameter</em> is thus a fancy name for a piece of
text in curly braces that the library knows how to translate into
something more relevant and useful before displaying it to the player
(for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{The subj dobj} {falls}</code> will
become either “The bird’s nest falls” or “The baby bird falls” depending
on which object Heidi drops). If you’re anxious to find out more about
message substitution parameters straight away you can read all about
them in the <a href="../manual/message.html#parameter">adv3Lite manual</a>, where
you can find a complete list.</p>

<p>The final statement, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit;</code>, prevents the rest
of the action from happening; otherwise we’d see the message “Dropped”
after the message about the object falling to the ground below, and the
object would actually end up in topOfTree instead of clearing, since
that’s where the standing handling for Drop would put it. The difference
between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abort</code> is that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code>
stops the action in its tracks but allows the rest of the turn cycle
(Daemons, Fuses and advancing the turn count, but not the after action
notifications) to go ahead, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abort</code>
additionally skips the entire remainder of the turn cycle (so that it
doesn’t even count as a turn).</p>

<p>Now try compiling and running the game again to check that everything
once again behaves as you expect.</p>
