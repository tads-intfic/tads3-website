<h1 id="scoring">Scoring</h1>

<p>In older adventure games it used to be conventional to keep a tally of
the player’s score. This is far from so universal in modern IF, much of
which can get on perfectly well without a score, especially when the
emphasis is more on the story than the game. Some works of IF do still
tally the player’s score, however, if only as a rough indicator of
progress through the game. While the Airport Game doesn’t actually need
a score, and would work perfectly well without, it is the sort of game
where keeping score would not be inappropriate, so in this section we’ll
briefly discuss how to go about it.</p>

<p>The various methods of keeping score are discussed in the section on
<a href="../manual/score.html">Scoring</a> in the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>. Here
we’ll look at just one of them, which is probably the best to use unless
there is a specific reason for not doing so (such as the presence of
multiple possible routes through the game). This method consists of
defining a number of <strong>Achievement</strong> objects and calling their
<strong>awardPointsOnce()</strong> method when the player does something that merits
a points increase. You can also use the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awardPoints()</code> method, but the advantage of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awardPointsOnce()</code> is that it ensures that
players are not awarded the same points again for repeating the same
action. Using Achievement objects in this way has a couple of other
advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It makes it easy to keep track of what the player has been awarded
points for, and to inform the player of this;</li>
  <li>It enables the game to calculate the maximum possible score
automatically.</li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps the best place to start in devising a scoring system for the
Airport game is to list what we might want to award points for, which
comes down to listing the key tasks the player needs to achieve in order
to win the game. The principal ones would seem to be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Finding the plane ticket</li>
  <li>Showing the ticket to Angela to board the plane</li>
  <li>Getting safely off the plane again (past Pablo Cortez)</li>
  <li>Turning off the power to the metal detector</li>
  <li>Opening the door to the Security Area</li>
  <li>Opening the suitcase</li>
  <li>Wearing the Pilot’s Uniform</li>
  <li>Entering the cockpit</li>
  <li>Taking off safely (thus winning the game)</li>
</ol>

<p>To make this come out at a round total of 100 possible points, let’s say
we’ll award ten points for each of these achievements apart from opening
the suitcase and flying the plane, for which we’ll award 15 points each.</p>

<p>To define an Achievement object we need to specify the number of points
it’s worth and the text describing the achievement. This can be done
very simply using the Achievement template, so that, for example, our
achievement objects might look like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ticketAchievement: Achievement +10 "finding the plane ticket";
    boardingAchievement: Achievement +10 "boarding the plane";
    escapeAchievement: Achievement +10 "escaping Pablo Cortez";
    powerAchievement: Achievement +10 "cutting the power to the metal detector";
    securityAchievement: Achievement +10 "opening the security door";
    suitcaseAchievement: Achievement +15 "opening the suitcase";
    uniformAchievement: Achievement +10 "putting on the pilot's uniform";
    cockpitAchievement: Achievement +10 "entering the cockpit";
    flyingAchievement: Achievement +15 "flying the plane";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All we have to do now is to ensure that carrying out the appropriate
action calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awardPointsOnce(</code>) on the
appropriate Achievement object. For example, for the first achievement:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ticket: Thing 'ticket'
        "It's a ticket for flight TI 179 to Buenos Aires. "
        
        readDesc = (desc)
        specialDesc = "A ticket lies on the ground. "
        useSpecialDesc = (location == getOutermostRoom)
        
        bulk = 1
        
        dobjFor(Take)
        {
            action()
            {
                inherited;
                ticketAchievement.awardPointsOnce();
            }   
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you compile and run the game and try this, you’ll find that the
points are awarded only the first time you pick up the ticket; the
awardPointsOnce() method makes sure the points are awarded only once.</p>

<p>The second achievement is awarded when the player character shows Angela
the ticket:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    ++ GiveShowTopic @ticket
        topicResponse()
        {
            "&lt;q&gt;Here you are,&lt;/q&gt; you say, holding out the ticket for {the angela}
            to see.\b
            She glances down at the ticket in your hand, and temporarily takes it
            off you to check. &lt;q&gt;That's fine, sir,&lt;/q&gt; she assures you as she
            returns it to you. &lt;q&gt;Please move to the rear of the plane to find a
            seat.&lt;/q&gt; ";
            angelaGreetingState.ticketSeen = true;
            boardingAchievement.awardPointsOnce();
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next achievement needs just a little more thought. The points are
awarded when the player reaches the Jetway from the plane, but only when
Pablo Cortez is threatening people at the front of the plane. There’s
more than one way we could test for this, but one that’s as good as any
other is to test for whether the takeover Scene is happening. If it is,
we can then award the points in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">travelerEntering()</code> method of the jetway Room:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    jetway: Room 'Jetway' 'jetway;short enclosed; walkway'
        "This is little more than a short enclosed walkway leading west-east from
        the gate to the plane. &lt;&lt;if takeover.isHappening&gt;&gt; Right now it's thronging
        with a stream of disgruntled passengers who have just been forced to
        disembark from their flight. &lt;&lt;else unless takeover.hasHappened&gt;&gt;You seem to
        be the only person here, as if everyone else has already boarded.&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; "
        
        west = gate3
        east: TravelConnector
        {
            destination = planeFront
            
            canTravelerPass(traveler) { return !takeover.isHappening; }
            explainTravelBarrier(traveler)
            {
                "You dare not go back aboard the plane until you've found a rather
                more effective disguise than a handful of cleaning items. ";
            }
        }
        
        travelerEntering(traveler, origin) 
        {
            if(traveler == me &amp;&amp; takeover.isHappening)
                escapeAchievement.awardPointsOnce();
        }    
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we’ve established the principle, implementing the scoring for
most of the other achievements can be left as an exercise for the
interested reader. There’s one additional point to consider when we come
to award the final points for flying the plane, however, namely that in
addition to awarding the points we’ll want to display the final score
and give the player the option of requesting a full breakdown of the
score. We’ll probably want to offer the same option too even if the
player character kills himself with a botched take-off attempt, so we’ll
want to tweak the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eachTurn()</code> method of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">takeOff</code> Scene thus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    takeoff: Scene   
        ...
     
     
        eachTurn()
        {
            local oldSpeed = asi.airspeed;
            
            if(controlColumn.position &lt; 0)
            {
                if(asi.airspeed &gt;= 115)
                {
                    "The aircraft leaves the ground and continues up into the sky,
                    climbing rapidly above the city. Once you've gained enough
                    height you turn the plane --- not south towards Bogota but north
                    towards Miami. Hopefully those hoodlums back in passenger cabin
                    won't notice, though, at least, not until it's far too late. You
                    reach for the radio to call ahead and arrange a suitable
                    reception committee, and then settle back in your seat, content
                    with a job well done. ";
                    
                    flyingAchievement.awardPointsOnce();
                    
                    finishGameMsg(ftVictory, [finishOptionUndo, finishOptionFullScore]);
                }
                else if(asi.airspeed &gt; 90)
                {
                    "The aircraft leaves the ground for a moment and then stalls,
                    rapidly losing speed and bumping back down onto the runway. ";

                }
                else
                    "The aircraft judders slightly but nothing else happens; it
                    isn't traveling nearly fast enough to take off. ";
            }
            
            local thrust = toInteger(thrustLever.curSetting) * 400 - asi.airspeed;

<p>The same option should probably be added when the player character
manages to get himself killed in other ways (notably by provoking Cortez
into shooting him), but this, too, can be left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>
