<h1 id="inheritance-modification-and-overriding">Inheritance, Modification and Overriding</h1>

<p>We have already discussed the basic principles of inheritance above,
when we observed that any object or class you define in your game must
inherit from one or more classes (the so-called superclasses of the
class or object being defined). In this section we shall discuss a few
of the practical consequences of this, and how to make use of them when
writing Interactive Fiction with adv3Lite.</p>

<h2 id="overriding">Overriding</h2>

<p>You may recall towards the end of the previous chapter we tested for the
nest being placed on the branch with the following code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + branch: Thing 'wide firm bough; flat; branch'
        "It's flat enough to support a small object. "
        
        iFixed = true
        isListed = true
        contType = On
        
        afterAction()
        {
            if(nest.isIn(self))
                finishGameMsg(ftVictory, [finishOptionUndo]);
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But you may be wondering, where exactly did this
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method come from, and how does
the Heidi game know how to use it? The answer is that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> is in fact defined on Thing, and
that the action-handling routines in the adv3Lite library know that they
have to call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method on every
Thing in scope after the performance of each successful action. On the
Thing class, however, the afterAction() routine is defined like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class Thing:  Mentionable
      ...
      
      afterAction() { }
     
      ...
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thus the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method on Thing is an
empty method that does nothing at all (since in general we don’t want
most objects to react to actions, and in any case the library can’t know
how you would want particular objects to react in your particular game).
What the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method on the branch
object does is to <em>override</em> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code>
method define on the Thing class, so that when
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch.afterAction()</code> is called, it’s the
branch’s version of afterAction that’s used.</p>

<p>This is about as simple an example of overriding as one can get. To
understand the full implications we need a slightly more complex one.
The Thing class defines an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOn</code> property to
determine whether a Thing is switched on or off. It also defines an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isSwitchable</code> property to determine whether
that Thing can be switched on and off (obviously most things can’t). On
the Thing class this property and this method are defined as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    isSwitchable = nil

    makeOn(stat) { isOn = stat; }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to create a Thing that can be switched on and off, we’d
therefore need to override its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isSwitchable</code>
property to true, for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    lightSwitch: Thing 'light switch'
       "It's just an ordinary light switch that can be turned on and off. "
       isSwitchable = true
       isFixed = true
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s all we have to do in adv3Lite to create a light switch (by the
way, I hope by now it’s obvious why we also defined
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isFixed = true</code>; light switches aren’t
generally the kinds of things you can pick up and carry around with you
unless the electrician hasn’t fitted them yet). In particular the
lightSwitch object inherits from Thing the handling of the SWITCH ON and
SWITCH OFF commands, the rule that these commands can be carried out if
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isSwitchable</code> is true, the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOn</code> property that determines whether or not
the Thing is currently switched on or off, and the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makeOn(stat)</code> method that’s used by the SWITCH
ON and SWITCH OFF commands; the former calls
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makeOn(true)</code> and the latter
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makeOn(nil)</code>.</p>

<p>That’s all fine as far as it goes, and thanks to inheritance we’re
getting a lot of the right kind of behaviour on our light switch simply
by defining a couple of properties, but in practice it probably isn’t
enough. Normally when you turn a light switch on and off you want
something else to happen, like a light going on and off, and you’d
probably want the same in your game. The obvious way to handle this
would be to <em>override</em> the makeOn(stat) method on the lightSwitch to
light up or turn off a light bulb somewhere. Here’s a first (but
erroneous) attempt:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    lightSwitch: Thing 'light switch'
       "It's just an ordinary light switch that can be turned on and off. "
       isSwitchable = true
       isFixed = true
       
       makeOn(stat) { lightBulb.makeLit(stat); }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Can you see what’s wrong with this? We’ll assume you’ve defined the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lightBulb</code> object elsewhere, and I can assure
you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makeLit(stat)</code> is another method defined on
Thing, so the code will make the bulb light up and go out again. The
problem is that by overriding makeOn(stat) in this way we’ve removed
what it originally did on Thing so we’re no longer keeping track of
whether the light switch is turned on and off. One way to fix it would
be to copy the original code from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thing.makeOn(stat)</code> into
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lightSwitch.makeOn(stat)</code>, giving us:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    lightSwitch: Thing 'light switch'
       "It's just an ordinary light switch that can be turned on and off. "
       isSwitchable = true
       isFixed = true
       
       makeOn(stat) 
       { 
         isOn = stat; 
         lightBulb.makeLit(stat); 
       }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would certainly work, and after a fashion it does solve the
problem, but it really isn’t a terribly good solution. Although in this
case it doesn’t seem much effort to copy a single line of code, if we
were overriding a rather more elaborate method it would both tedious and
wasteful to have to copy lines and lines of code into our overridden
method, especially if all we wanted to do is to add a single line of
code or two to what the method does on the base class. Also, if there’s
subsequently an improvement or correction to the method on the base
class (perhaps in a new version of the library), our overridden method
won’t benefit from it. In fact, if we override methods in the manner of
the code sample immediately above, we’re missing out on most of the
benefits of the inheritance model. The proper solution is to use the
<strong>inherited</strong> keyword, thus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    lightSwitch: Thing 'light switch'
       "It's just an ordinary light switch that can be turned on and off. "
       isSwitchable = true
       isFixed = true
       
       makeOn(stat) 
       { 
         inherited(stat); 
         lightBulb.makeLit(stat); 
       }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited(stat)</code> means “at this point in
the code, do whatever the method I’m overriding would have done”. In
this case, then, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited(stat)</code> effectively
calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thing.makeOn(stat)</code> to carry out the base
handling that would have been carried out on Thing. Note that the call
to the inherited method doesn’t have to be the first statement in the
overriding method; you can put it wherever it’s convenient to do so
within the overriding method. However, you do have to call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interited()</code> with the same parameter list as
the method you’re overriding; since we’re overriding the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makeOn(stat)</code> method of Thing, we thus need to
call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited(stat)</code>.</p>

<p>This is a <em>very</em> important technique to bear in mind when you come to
override object and class methods in your own code, as you’ll find
yourself increasingly doing as the more adventurous you become with what
you want your games to do. While in certain cases, like the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method on the branch object in
the first example above, we may know from experience that the base
method on Thing doesn’t do anything so there’s no point in calling the
inherited method when overriding it, if in any doubt at all, the best
rule of thumb is to always include a call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited()</code> when overriding a method.</p>

<h2 id="modifying">Modifying</h2>

<p>In addition to inheriting behaviour from classes (and objects), we can
also modify existing classes and objects, by making use of the
<strong>modify</strong> keyword. This is best explained by means of an example.
Suppose we were writing a game in which there were going to be a lot of
light switches in different places, each one controlling a different
light bulb. It might become a bit tedious to have to define the same
code over and over again on each and every light switch. An alternative
would be to add the desired behaviour to the Thing class by modifying
it, perhaps like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    modify Thing
       bulbObj = nil
       isSwitchable = (bulbObj != nil)
       
       makeOn(stat)
       {
          inherited(stat);
          if(bulbObj != nil)
             bulbObj.makeLit(stat);
       }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are several things to note here. The first is that we’ve added a
new property, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bulbObj</code>, to the Thing class to
hold a reference to the light bulb that should be lit when this Thing is
switched on. We’ve then overridden the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isSwitchable</code> property so that it becomes true
if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bulbObj</code> is not
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, in other words if we have defined a bulb
object associated with this Thing. This means that when we come to
define our individual light switch objects, we don’t have to remember to
define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isSwitchable = true </code>along with setting
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bulbObj</code> property to indicate the bulb
controlled by this switch. Next note the use of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inherited()</code> keyword here to call the version
of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makeOn()</code> method on the original Thing
class. Finally, note the check in the if statement to make sure we don’t
accidentally try to call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makeLit()</code> method
of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> value, which would cause a run-time
error that could easily happen if we made a Thing switchable without
defining an associated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bulbObj</code>. If we modified
Thing as above we could then define an individual light switch object
thus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    lightSwitch: Thing 'light switch'
       "It's just an ordinary light switch that can be turned on and off. "
       bulbObj = lightBulb
       isFixed = true   
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a big improvement if we have a lot of light switches to define
in our game. It has to be said, though, that unless virtually every
switchable object in our game was going to be a light switch, and
perhaps even then, this probably isn’t the best way to go about
addressing this particular issue. We’d almost certainly be better off
defining a custom LightSwitch class along the following lines:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class LightSwitch: Thing
       bulbObj = nil
       isSwitchable = true
       isFixed = true
       
       makeOn(stat)
       {
          inherited(stat);
          if(bulbObj != nil)
             bulbObj.makeLit(stat);
       }
    ;

    ...

    lightSwitch: LightSwitch 'light switch'
       "It's just an ordinary light switch that can be turned on and off. "
       bulbObj = lightBulb      
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is neater primarily because this way we can now give the light
switch behaviour only to those objects that actually need it, and also
because we can simply define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isSwitchable =
true</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isFixed = true</code> on the
LightSwitch class knowing that these will almost certainly be the
appropriate values on every light switch we create. The example
nevertheless serves to illustrate the principle of modifying classes,
and in future chapters we shall come across cases when this is indeed
the best approach. In the meantime you may have noticed that the code on
the modified Thing class and the code on the new LightSwitch class look
very similar. This is no accident: what we are in fact doing when we use
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modify</code> keyword on a class (or object) is
to create a new version of that class (or object) that inherits from the
old one.</p>
