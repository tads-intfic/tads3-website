<h1 id="finishing-touches">Finishing Touches</h1>

<p>We’ve nearly completed our first pass through the game. There’s just a
couple more things to do. The first is to prevent Heidi climbing the
tree while holding both the bird and the nest in her hands (this would
be rather awkward to do!); to get the bird back in its nest on the
branch Heidi must either put the bird in the nest and then carry the
nest, or else make two trips up the tree, one with the nest and one with
the bird. In this simple game we’ll enforce this in the simplest way
possible, by limiting the amount Heidi can carry at any one time. First
change the definition of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">me</code> object:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + me: Thing 'you;;heidi'   
        isFixed = true    
        proper = true
        ownsContents = true
        person = 2   
        contType = Carrier    
        bulkCapacity = 1
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bulkCapacity = 1</code> to the definition of
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">me</code> object limits the total bulk Heidi can
carry to one unit of bulk at a time (here the ‘unit’ of bulk is whatever
the game author wants it to be, that is, you define units of bulk on
whatever scale suits the purposes of your game). It wouldn’t normally be
a good idea to put such a savage carrying restriction on the player
character’s carrying capacity, but there are so few portable objects in
this game that we can get away with it.</p>

<p>For this to have any effect, we also need to give some bulk to the two
portable objects in question, the bird and the nest, by defining
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bulk = 1</code> on both of them:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + bird: Thing 'baby bird;;nestling'
        "Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. "
        
        bulk = 1
    ;


    clearing: Room 'A forest clearing'
        "A tall sycamore stands in the middle of this clearing. The path winds
        southwest through the trees. "
        
        southwest = forest
        up = topOfTree
    ;

    + nest: Thing 'bird\'s nest; carefully woven; moss twigs'
        "The nest is carefully woven of twigs and moss. "
        
        contType = In   
        bulk = 1
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try making the changes indicated above and then compiling and running
the game once more. This time you’ll find that Heidi can’t pick up the
nest while holding the bird or <em>vice versa</em>, but that she can put the
bird in the nest, pick up the nest, and then climb the tree.</p>

<p>The final change is a bit more complex. At the moment there’s no way of
winning the game (or ending it in any other way, apart from issuing a
QUIT command). We want the game to end victoriously when Heidi restores
the nest to the branch (preferably with the bird inside it, but we’ll
leave that little detail till later). There are several ways we could do
this, but the one we’ll use here is to use the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch</code> to test whether the nest is on the
branch, and then end the game in victory if it is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + branch: Thing 'wide firm bough; flat; branch'
        "It's flat enough to support a small object. "
        
        iFixed = true
        isListed = true
        contType = On
        
        afterAction()
        {
            if(nest.isIn(self))
                finishGameMsg(ftVictory, [finishOptionUndo]);
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This introduces several new concepts at once; we’ll explain them briefly
here and then give a slightly more systematic explanation in the next
chapter.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> is the first example we’ve seen
of a <em>method</em>. A method is like a property in that it’s associated with
a specific object (or class of objects), but unlike a property, which
just holds a piece of data, a method contains one or more <em>statements</em>
of procedural code. This code is <em>run</em> or <em>executed</em> (the two mean the
same thing) when the method is <em>called</em> or <em>invoked</em> (again, for our
purposes, the two mean the same thing).</p>

<p>As its name possibly suggests, the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method is called on every object
in scope (i.e., roughly speaking, every object in the immediate vicinity
of the actor) just after an action is performed. Since Heidi must
perform some action (like putting the nest on the branch) in the
immediate vicinity of the branch in order for the nest to end up on the
branch, we can confidently use the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method of the branch to test for
the presence of the nest on the branch. We do so by using an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement takes the form:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if(expression)
    statement;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if(expression)
{
    statement;
    statement;
    ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the first case, <span class="synPar">statement;</span> is executed if
<span class="synPar">expression</span> evaluates to true; in the second
the entire block of statements between the opening and closing braces, {
}, is executed if <span class="synPar">expression</span> evaluates to
true. For this purpose, an expression is considered to be true if it
evaluates to anything other than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>.</p>

<p>In this instance, the expression being tested is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nest.isIn(self)</code>.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isIn(*obj*)</code> is a method of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Thing</code> class that evaluates to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> (or returns
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>) if the object it’s called in is either
directly or indirectly in <em>obj</em>. Although we want to know whether the
nest is <em>on</em> the branch, programmatically we just test whether the nest
lies <em>in</em> the branch’s containment tree.</p>

<p>You might have expected that we’d test for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nest.isIn(branch)</code>, and that would indeed have
worked, but using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> here is generally
better practice. In TADS 3 <em>self</em> means ‘the current object’ or ‘the
object this property or method is being defined on’. Since we’re
defining the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> here
refers to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch</code>. The advantage of using self
rather than branch in this context is that it makes our code more
generically applicable and less error-prone. If, for example, at some
later point we were to change our mind about calling the branch object
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch</code>, and decided to call it
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bough</code> instead, its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method would still work as
expected without our having to remember to change
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isIn(branch)</code> to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isIn(bough)</code> since self would now automatically
refer to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bough</code>.</p>

<p>So, if the nest is on the branch when the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch</code> is invoked, the statement
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finishGameMsg(ftVictory,
\[finishOptionUndo\]);</code> will be executed. But what does this do?
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finishGameMsg()</code> is the first example we’ve
encountered of an adv3Lite <em>function</em>. Like a method, a function is a
block of code that contains one or more procedural statements (i.e. code
to be executed). Unlike a method, a function is not associated with any
particular object. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finishGameMsg()</code> is a
function defined in the adv3Lite library for use when we want to finish
the game. It takes two <em>arguments</em>. The first defines how we want the
game to end. Here we want it to end with the player winning, so we use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ftVictory</code> (you can think of this being short
for finishTypeVictory, although the library wouldn’t recognize this
longer form). Other possibilities included
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ftDeath</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ftFailure</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ftGameOver</code>. Alternatively, you could just
use a single-quoted string with your own message, such as ‘YOU HAVE DONE
WELL’ or ‘THAT WAS DISMAL’.</p>

<p>The second parameter we pass to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finishGameMsg()</code> function is a list of
finishOptions. When you call the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finishGameMsg()</code> function the game displays
your chosen message and then offers the player a list of options. These
always include the options to RESTART the story, RESTORE a saved game or
QUIT, but here we also want to offer the player the option to UNDO his
or her last turn (in case s/he wants to carry on playing the game to try
something different, perhaps), so we include the option
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finishOptionUndo</code>. The square brackets round
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finishOptionUndo</code> indicate that we are actually
passing a list of options to the function, though a list that here
contains only one item. There could have been more, e.g.,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\[finishOptionUndo, finishOptionCredits,
finishOptionFullScore, finishOptionAmusing\]</code>, but since we
haven’t defined any credits for this game, and we haven’t been keeping
score, and we haven’t defined any amusing things for the player to try
after winning the game, we really don’t need these other options here.</p>

<p>This is as far as we’ll take the Heidi game for now. We’ll add some more
refinements to it in Chapter Five, but we introduced a lot of new
concepts in a bit of a rush at the end of this chapter just to explain
how the game could be won, and we actually covered quite a bit of ground
before that, so before adding any further finishing touches to our Heidi
game we should pause and take stock, which is what we’ll do in the next
chapter. In the meantime, here’s the complete listing of what the Heidi
game should now look like:</p>
