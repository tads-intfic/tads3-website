<h1 id="methods-functions-and-statements">Methods, Functions and Statements</h1>

<h2 id="methods-and-functions">Methods and Functions</h2>

<p>Methods and functions are quite similar both in appearance and, if
you’ll pardon the pun, function. Methods and functions are both
containers for blocks of code, that is, for a series of <em>statements</em>, or
instructions to the computer to carry out the commands the method or
function defines. The principal difference between them is that a method
belongs to an object, whereas a function is free-standing. For example,
in the Heidi example we developed in the previous chapter,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> was a method of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch</code> object, while
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finishGameMsg()</code> was a function defined in the
adv3Lite library (in fact, in this particular instance, precisely the
same function is defined in the adv3 library too).</p>

<p>The syntax for defining a function is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>functionName ( [ paramName [ , paramName ... ]  ]  )
{
   functionBody
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that to define a function you start with the function name,
then put an opening parenthesis, then a list of parameters the function
takes, then a closing parenthesis, following which you write the body of
the function between opening and closing braces. To give a couple of
more concrete examples:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    sayHello()
    {
       "Hello World!";
    }

    double(x)
    {
       return x * 2;
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sayHello()</code> function simply displays the
text “Hello World!” when it is invoked. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double()</code> function accepts a single number as a
parameter and returns double that number. It could be used like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      y = double(3);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which would result in y containing the value 6. (In this code fragment,
y is a variable; we’ll explain variables in the next subsection).</p>

<p>The sayHello() example incidentally shows that if you want to define a
function (or method) that takes no parameters, you simply follow its
name with a pair of parentheses. A parameter is simply a temporary
storage area (just like a variable) that you can use to pass a value to
a function or method. In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double()</code> example,
calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double(3)</code> causes the x parameter to
take the value 3, so that when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double(3)</code>
executes the statement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return x \* 2;</code> it first
multiplies 3 by 2 (since x now has the value 3) and then returns the
result (i.e. 6) to the caller.</p>

<p>Incidentally, you’ll often come across <em>parameters</em> referred to as
<em>arguments</em>. Technically the two terms mean something slightly
different: parameters are what you define when you define the function
or method, arguments are what you pass when you call the function or
method, but for most practical purposes this is a distinction that
seldom matters, and if you refer to both parameters and arguments as
‘arguments’ you probably won’t get into much trouble!</p>

<p>A method is defined almost exactly like a function, except that its
definition occurs within the body of an object or class. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    class Greeter: Thing
       greet()
       {
          "&lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt; says hello! ";
       }
    ;

    bob: Greeter 'Bob; tall; man; him'
      "He's a very tall man. "
      
      doSum(x, y)
      {
         "&lt;q&gt;Let me see,&lt;/q&gt; says Bob. &lt;q&gt;By my reckoning,&lt;&lt;x&gt;&gt; plus &lt;&lt;y&gt;&gt; is
           &lt;&lt;x + y&gt;&gt;. ";
      }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this somewhat contrived example, the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Greeter</code> class defines a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">greet()</code> method, which the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob</code> object inherits (since it’s of class
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Greeter</code>). Calling
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob.greet()</code> would result in the display of
“Bob says hello!” while calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bob.doSum(10,
5)</code> would result in the display of ‘“Let me see,” says Bob. “By my
reckoning 10 plus 5 is 15.”’</p>

<p>In this example bob gets its name property via the vocab property we
defined using the Thing template (since Greeter inherits from Thing, we
can still use the Thing template with it). This incidentally illustrates
another important difference between a method and a function. A method
can refer to other properties and methods of the object on which it’s
defined. A function can’t do this because it isn’t part of any object.
Likewise a method can use the special keyword
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> to refer to the object on which it’s
defined; a function can’t do this since there would be no object for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self</code> to refer to, a function not being part of
any object.</p>

<p>By the way, these examples have all been of very simple methods and
functions with a single line of code (in fact, a single statement). In
fact a function or method can contain as many statements as you like
(although if a function or method starts to grow too big that may be a
sign that it should be broken up into a number of functions or methods).
We have simply kept these examples as simple as possible to illustrate
the basic principles of defining functions and methods.</p>

<h2 id="variables"><span id="variables">Variables</span></h2>

<p>A variable is simply a temporary container for a piece of information,
such as a number, a piece of text, a list, a reference to an object, or
a special value like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>. In TADS 3 all variables are <em>local</em>,
which means that they can only exist within a function or method, and
only keep their value for as long as that function or method is being
executed. In fact, the lifetime of a TADS 3 variable may be even less
than that, for a variable only persists for as long as the <em>block</em> in
which it is defined is being executed, where a block is any set of
statements enclosed in a matching pair of opening and closing braces
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{}</code>). A method or function is simply the
outermost possible kind of enclosing block.</p>

<p>A variable must be <em>declared</em> before it can be used. A variable is
declared using the keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local</code>, followed by
one or more variable names (separated by commas, if there’s more than
one). A variable may optionally be <em>initialized</em> at the same time it is
declared by following it with an equals sign followed by whatever value
you wish to give it. If a variable is declared but not initialized it
will have the value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> (i.e. nothing at all)
until it is assigned a value. The following are all examples of legal
variable declarations:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      local a;
      local numberOfEggs, weightOfFlour, quantityOfButter;
      local price = 10, weight, title = 'cake recipe';
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On the whole it’s best to give your variables meaningful names as in the
second and third examples above, since this will make your code easier
to read (and maintain). For some purposes (such as a loop counter), a
brief single-letter variable name may suffice, however. A variable name
should be unique in the block of code in which it occurs, and you should
try to avoid using the name of an object, method, function or other
identifier as a variable name since this is likely to confuse the
compiler (as well as you) and would probably lead to compilation errors.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it’s quite okay to use the same variable name in
different functions and methods. If you define a local variable called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> in a function called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showName()</code> and another local variable called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> in a method called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mixCake()</code> the two
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> variables will have no relation to each
other at all, and no confusion will occur.</p>

<p>As its name suggests, a variable is something whose value can vary as
your code is executed. Consider the following code snippet:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    someFunction()
    {
       local myVar = 2;
       myVar = myVar + 2;  // now myVar is 4
       myVar = 'Hello';    // now myVar is 'Hello'
       myVar += ' World!'; // now myVar is 'Hello World!'   
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="statements">Statements</h2>

<p>With one or two exceptions, we were able to write almost the whole of
<em>The Adventures of Heidi</em> in the previous chapter using purely
declarative programming, that is by defining objects and declaring the
values of certain of their properties. Although adv3Lite tries to let
you write your game as far as possible this way, as we’ve already seen
in the code for ending the Heidi game, you can’t do everything that way,
and the more original, interesting and sophisticated you want your game
to be, the more you’ll need to supplement your declarative code with
<em>procedural code</em>, that is code that consists of a set of instructions
(i.e. a procedure) telling your game what to do under certain
circumstances. Such code is made up of individual <em>statements</em>.</p>

<p>A <em>statement</em> is simply an instruction to your game to carry out a
particular task, expressed in the TADS 3 programming language. With one
or two exceptions that need not concern us here, statements can only
occur within a function or method (one obvious exception would be
statements that define (the header of a) function or method). In this
section, however, we shall be entirely concerned with <em>procedural</em>
statements, that is the kind of statements that can be put inside a
method or function to make it carry out a particular procedure.</p>

<p>The kinds of procedural statements you’ll most commonly used are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>declarations</li>
  <li>assignment statements</li>
  <li>method and function calls</li>
  <li>flow control statements</li>
  <li>double-quoted string statements</li>
</ul>

<p>As we’ll see, some of these kinds can be combined into a single
statement, but for convenience of presentation we’ll take each kind in
turn. But one feature all procedural statements have in common is that
they must be terminated with a semicolon.</p>

<h3 id="declarations">Declarations</h3>

<p>A declaration statement is one that declares a new local
<a href="#variables">variable</a>, as we have already seen above. The following
statement declares the local variable
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myNewVar</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local myNewVar;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As already noted, a local variable must be declared before it can be
used, but a variable can be declared and assigned an initial value in
the same statement, for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local myNewVar = 10;
    local someonesName = 'John Doe';
    local obj = bird;
    local bool = true;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example could alternatively be written all as one statement:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local myNewVar = 10, someonesName = 'John Doe', obj = bird, bool = true;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="assignment-statments">Assignment Statments</h3>

<p>An assignment statement assigns the value of an expression to a local
variable or object property. It has the form:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  lvalue = expression;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <em>lvalue</em> is the property or variable to which the value is being
assigned, and <em>expression</em> is any valid TADS 3 expression. Examples of
assignment statements include:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      x = 2;
      x = x + 3;
      obj = bird;
      obj.name = 'parrot';
      str = 'Hello' + ' World';
      val = double(x + 1) / 3 + 18;  // val is now 22
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An <em>expression</em> can be any legal combination of variables, property
names, function and/or method calls, and operators. <em>Operators</em> include
the common arithmetic operators <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+ - / \*</code> (the
last two of which are used for division and multiplication), the string
concatenation operator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code>, the logical
operators <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;&amp; \|\| </code>and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code> (and, or and not), and the comparison
operators <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">== != \&gt; \&lt; \&gt;=</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\&lt;=</code> (equals, not equals, less than, greater
than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to).</p>

<p>NOTE. Just as in C (whose syntax TADS 3 borrows to a large extent) be
very careful not to confuse the assignment operator
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> with the test for equality operator
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code>. Consider the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      a = 3; // Assigns the value 3 to a.
      a == 3; // Tests whether a is 3 (and here evaluates to true), but doesn't do anything.
      
      if(a = 4)   // legal but doesn't do what you probably expect 
         say ('a is 4!')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The statement <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a == 3</code> is a legal statement
because a statement can consist just of an expression, even if the
expression doesn’t do anything as here. The test <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if(a
= 4)</code> is legal, because an assignment like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a =
4</code> is also an expression (it evaluates to 4). But since 4 is
considered a true value (being neither zero nor
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>), the test will be passed whatever the
initial value of a, causing ‘a is 4!’ to be displayed no matter what.</p>

<p>There are also various short form assignment statements. Because it’s so
common to write statements like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      count = count + 2;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be abbreviated to:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      count += 2;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And so on with similar operators like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-= \*=</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/=</code>. Because adding or subtracting 1 from a
number is so common, this can be abbreviated even further:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      
      count++; // equivalent to count += 1;
      count--; // equivalent to count -= 1;  
      ++count; // equivalent to count += 1;
      --count; // equivalent to count -= 1;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">++count</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count++</code> is simply the point at which the
incrementing of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> occurs. This can be
illustrated briefly like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      count = 0;
      a = count++; // a is now 0 and count is now 1, because count is incremented after its value is assigned to a
      b = ++count; // b and count are now both 2, because count is incremented before its value is assigned to b
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="method-and-function-calls">Method and Function Calls</h3>

<p>As we have seen, an expression by itself can constitute a perfectly
valid statement. Often it would be a pointless statement; the expression
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count + 1;</code> is valid as a statement, but it
doesn’t actually do anything (in particular, it doesn’t increase the
value of count by 1). But expressions that consist of method or function
calls are often useful as statements, because of their so-called
side-effects. “Side-effect” is actually a slightly odd term here,
because what we mean is what the method or function actually does.
Examples we have actually seen include:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      finishGameMsg(ftVictory, [finishOptionUndo]); // ends the game
      bird.moveInto(nest); // moves the bird into the nest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you come to write more TADS 3 code (whether in adv3Lite or adv3)
you’ll probably find yourself using this kind of statement a lot.</p>

<h3 id="flow-control-statements">Flow Control Statements</h3>

<p>The statements we have discussed so far allow you to write methods and
functions that do things, but they don’t give you much flexibility or
control. The power of any computer language comes from its ability to
take different routes through the code depending on circumstances, and
that’s every bit as important when writing Interactive Fiction as it is
for other kinds of application.</p>

<p>One of the most common — and most important — statements is the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement. We have already met it (in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">afterAction()</code> method of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch</code> object) in the form:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if ( conditionExpression )
  thenPart
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <span class="synPar">conditionExpression</span> is an expression
that typically evaluates to either true or nil and
<span class="synPar">thenPart</span> is either a single statement or a
block (enclosed by opening and closing braces) containing multiple
statements. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    + branch: Thing 'wide firm bough; flat; branch'
        "It's flat enough to support a small object. "
        
        iFixed = true
        isListed = true
        contType = On
        
        afterAction()
        {
            if(nest.isIn(self))
                finishGameMsg(ftVictory, [finishOptionUndo]);
        }
    ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s also a second form of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement
that looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if ( conditionExpression )
  thenPart
else
  elsePart 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this form of the if statement, both
<span class="synPar">thenPart</span> and
<span class="synPar">elsePart</span> may be either a single statement or
a block of statements. If
<span class="synPar">conditionExpression</span> evaluates to anything
but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>, then
<span class="synPar">thenPart</span> is executed, but if
<span class="synPar">conditionExpression</span> does evaluate to either
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> then
<span class="synPar">elsePart</span> is executed. For example;</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     if(obj.weight &gt; 50)
     {
        "You can't budge it. ";
     }
     else
     {
        obj.moveInto(crevasse);
        "You push &lt;&lt;obj.theName&gt;&gt; over the edge, and it tumbles away out of sight. ";
     }
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example, if obj had a weight of 51, say, then the player would
see the “You can’t budge it” message, but if it had a weight of 50, obj
would be moved into the crevasse and the player would see the message
about it tumbling out of sight.</p>

<p>Another common flow-control statement is the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> statement, which terminates the
execution of a function or method. This has two forms:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> return;
 return expression;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first form simply terminates the function or method. The second
terminates it and returns the value of
<span class="synPar">expression</span> to the caller. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     
     absolute(x)
     {
        if(x &lt; 0)
           return -x;
           
        return x;
     }
     
     sayDivide(x, y)
     {
        if(y == 0)
        {
           "You can't divide by zero. ";
           return;
        }
        
        "&lt;&lt;x&gt;&gt; divided by &lt;&lt;y&gt;&gt; is &lt;&lt;x/y&gt;&gt;. ";
        return;
     }
     
     ...
     
       a = absolute(-40) // a is now 40
       a = sayDivide(a, 20) // a is now nil
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the second case, although the player would see the message “40
divided by 20 is 2”, since the function returns no value,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> will end up as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>.</p>

<p>The third common type of flow-control statement is the loop statement,
of which TADS 3 provides several. The most versatile (and hence common)
of these is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for </code>statement, which can take
several forms:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for ( [ initializer ]  ; [ condition ]  ; [ updater ]  )
  loopBody
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <span class="synPar">initializer</span> is either an ordinary
expression, or a list of local variable declarations, or a mix of both:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>( expression | local varName = expression )  [ , ... ] 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An example of this kind of for loop would be:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>      local count = 0;
      for(local i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++)
         count += i;  
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would sum the numbers from 1 to 10 and store the total (55) in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code>.</p>

<p>The second form of the for loop is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for ( [ local ]  loopVar in expression )
   loopBody
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this form of the for loop, <span class="synPar">expression</span>
would typically be a list (or an expression that evaluates to a list).
For example, to calculate the total bulk of the items carried by Heidi
(perhaps in a game where we didn’t restrict her carrying capacity quite
so much) we might use:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local totalBulk = 0;
    for(local item in heidi.contents)
       totalBulk += item.bulk;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The third form of the for loop is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for ( [ local ]  loopVar in fromExpr .. toExpr [ step stepExpr ]  )
   loopBody
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <em>fromExpr</em>, <em>toExpr</em>, and the optional <em>stepExpr</em> are expressions
that evaluate to integer values. If there’s no
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">step</code> clause, the default step value is 1. With
this form of the loop the first example (summing the numbers from 1 to
10) could have been written as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local count = 0;
    for(local i in 1..10)
      count += i;
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As an added bonus, we can combine these different forms of for loop into
a single statement. For example, the following could be used to display
an enumerated list of Heidi’s possessions:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    "Heidi is holding:\n";

    for(local item in heidi.contents, local i = 1 ;; i++)
       "&lt;&lt;i&gt;&gt;. &lt;&lt;item.aName&gt;&gt;\n";
     
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are not the only kind of loop (and other flow-control) statements
that TADS 3 provides, but they are the ones that are most commonly used.
We’ll explain any others that arise if and when we come to them.</p>

<h3 id="double-quoted-string-statements"><span id="dquote">Double-Quoted String Statements</span></h3>

<p>Although we’ve already used several examples of it, we should complete
this review of statement types by mentioning the double-quoted string
statement. This is simply an instruction to display some text to the
player, and takes the form of placing the text between double quote
marks, and ending the statement with a semicolon:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     
    "This text will be displayed to the player. ";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The same result can be achieved via a function call:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    say('This text will be displayed to the player. ');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the double-quoted string statement form is often more convenient.
Note that in this statement the text to be displayed can contain
embedded expressions, that is expressions enclosed in double
angle-brackets &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;. So for example we could write:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    "Heidi is carrying &lt;&lt;heidi.contents.length&gt;&gt; things right now. ";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example won’t read too well if Heidi is carrying just one
thing, and may not be ideal if she is completely empty handed, but we
can also use embedded expressions to change what’s displayed according
to various conditions, for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    local numItems = heidi.contents.length;
    "Heidi is &lt;&lt;if numItems == 0&gt;&gt; empty-handed&lt;&lt;else if numItems == 1&gt;&gt;carrying just one thing&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; carrying &lt;&lt;numItems&gt;&gt; things&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;. ";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Embedded expressions can also be used to vary what’s displayed either
randomly or sequentially, for example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    "Heidi is very&lt;&lt;one of&gt;&gt;sad &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt;happy &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt;energetic &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt;tired &lt;&lt;shuffled&gt;&gt; today. ";
    "Heidi is very&lt;&lt;one of&gt;&gt;sad &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt;happy &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt;energetic &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt;tired &lt;&lt;stopping&gt;&gt; today. "
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first statement will run through ‘sad’, ‘happy’, ‘energetic’ and
‘tired’ in random order, then shuffle the order and repeat through again
in the new order and so on. The second statement will run through ‘sad’,
‘happy’, ‘energetic’ and ‘tired’ in that order and then keep repeating
‘tired’. For a full list of the embedded expressions you can use, see
the section on “String Literals” in Part III of the <em>TADS 3 System
Manual</em>.</p>

<h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2>

<p>We have covered a lot of ground in rather a compressed manner in this
section. Don’t worry too much if it doesn’t all make perfect sense yet,
we’ll be explaining many of the new features again when we use them in
the games we’ll be looking at. To get the full story on the material we
have just sketched above, see the section on “Procedural Code” in Part
III of the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em>. You might also find it helpful to
look at the sections on “Fundamental Datatypes” and “Expressions and
Operators” in the same part of the <em>System Manual</em>. If you’re at all
unsure about the material we’ve just covered, or you’re interested in
going into more detail to get the full picture, now might be a good time
to read these three sections. On the other hand, if you’re comfortable
with what we’ve just covered in this section and would like to carry on
reading the next straight away, that’s fine too, but I would still
recommend that you read those three sections of the <a href="../../adv3/doc/sysman/cover.html">TADS 3 System
Manual</a> sooner or later.</p>
