<h1 id="exercises--samples">Exercises &amp; Samples</h1>

<p><a href="LearningT3Lite.pdf">Learning TADS 3 With Adv3Lite</a> contains a number of
exercises. Suggested solutions to some of those exercises are given
here. These may either be used in conjunction with the exercises or
simply studied separately as samples of code illustrating various parts
of the adv3Lite library. The sample games provided are as follows:</p>

<p><a href="Exercise%2011.t">Exercise 11</a> is primarily an illustration of Rooms,
TravelConnectors and TravelBarriers. It also contains an example of a
vehicle and a travel-pushable.</p>

<p><a href="Exercise%2013.t">Exercise 13</a> is primarily an illustration of various
kinds of Container. It also illustrates certain aspects of action
handling and defining new actions in the course of implementing things
with the various kinds of container.</p>

<p><a href="Exercise%2015.t">Exercise 15 - Bomb Disposal</a> is primarily an
illustration of Fuses and Daemons. It also illustrates starting and
ending a game, and the use of InitObjects, CollectiveGroups,
Consultables and more action handling.</p>

<p><a href="Exercise%2017.t">Exercise 17 - Light Sources</a> is primarily a
demonstration of various kinds of light source. Note that while it shows
how to create a fueled light source from scratch, in practice it might
be easier to use the <a href="../../extensions/docs/fueled.html">fueled light
source</a> extension. This example also
illustrates how to modify VerbRules (the grammar applicable to various
actions) and how to define an AMUSING option.</p>

<p><a href="Exercise%2018.t">Exercise 18 - Bedsitterland</a> is primarily an
illustration of nested rooms (such as Platforms and Booths), including
restricting reaching in and out of them.</p>

<p><a href="Exercise%2019.t">Exercise 19 - Locks and Gadgets</a> is primarily an
illustration of Lockable items, keys, and various types of gadgets and
controls such as dials, levers, switches and sliders. It also contains a
further example of implementing an AMUSING option.</p>

<p><a href="Exercise%2020.t">Exercise 20 - Lighthouse</a> is primarily an illustration
of implementing NPCs (Non-Player Characters), including conversation and
the use of ActorStates and AgendaItems.</p>

<p><a href="Exercise%2021.t">Exercise 21 - Sense &amp; Sensibility</a> is primarily an
illustration of SenseRegions and the sensory connections they provide.
It also illustrates the used of MultiLocs, Noises and Odors, as well as
a simple NPC and another travel-pushable. It shows how to create a
SoundEvent class from scratch, but in practice this might be more easily
done by making use of the <a href="../../extensions/docs/fueled.html">Sensory</a>
extension.</p>

<p><a href="Exercise%2022.t">Exercise 22 - Attachments</a> is primarily an
illustration of various kinds of Attachable class, albeit in the context
of what is probably the most complex game of any of the examples here.</p>

<p><a href="Exercise%2023.t">Exercise 23 - An Eventful Walk</a> is primarily an
illustration of EventLists, Menus, Hints and Scoring, although it also
includes a couple of examples of simple Scenes.</p>
